Analysis of ASSIST Articulation Structure and Policies
1. Articulation Agreement Structure on ASSIST.org
Groups, Sections, and Requirement Areas: Modern ASSIST articulation agreements are organized into Groups (numbered segments) and Sections (lettered sub-segments) to structure major or GE requirements​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. A Group typically corresponds to a broad requirement category or set of related requirements (for example, “Programming Requirement” or “Area 1: English Communication”). Each group is numbered sequentially in the agreement. Within a group, one or more Sections (labeled A, B, C, etc.) may appear. Sections represent either alternative pathways or sub-requirements within that group:
If the group’s instruction says “Complete A or B,” it means choose one section – i.e. complete either all requirements in Section A or all requirements in Section B (an either/or option)​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. In this case, each section is a distinct path to satisfy the group. For example, Group 1: Complete A or B might mean Section A covers one set of courses and Section B an alternate set, only one of which is needed.
If a group has no alternate sections (or the instruction is “N/A”), then all listed items in that group are required. This corresponds to “all_required” logic in ASSIST’s data model – the student must complete every course listed in the group. Even if such a group is split into multiple sections for readability (e.g. separating Math vs Science courses), there is no “or” between sections – all sections apply. (In the UI, no special choice instruction is shown for these groups.)
A Requirement Area is a term often used in general education agreements to denote a category of requirement (for instance, IGETC Area 4 or CSU GE Area A1). In major agreements, there may be similar higher-level headings (sometimes called “Requirement Titles,” like “Pre-Major Requirements”). These serve as descriptive headers for sets of groups. Essentially, requirement areas in GE articulation function as named groups corresponding to each GE category (Area 1, Area 2, etc.), each with its own completion rules.
Group Logic Types: Internally, ASSIST classifies group logic with types such as choose_one_section, all_required, and select_n_courses:
choose_one_section: The group offers two or more section options, of which only one full section must be completed. In the agreement text this is shown by an instruction like “Complete Section A or B.” For example, a UC requirement that can be met by either a two-course sequence (Section A) or an accelerated single course (Section B) would be structured this way. The student picks one path. (Group 1 in the case study below is an example.)
all_required: The default logic when no special choice is indicated – all courses listed in the group are required. The group instruction may be blank or “N/A.” In data terms, every course under that group (possibly spanning multiple sections) must be taken. For instance, a major might list 5 specific courses that are all mandatory; ASSIST will show them (sometimes split into sections by subject), but with no “or” instruction – meaning you need them all.
select_n_courses: The group requires a student to select a specified number (N) of courses from a larger list. The agreement will state something like “Select 2 courses from the following.” This indicates that out of that group’s list of options, any N will satisfy the requirement. For example, a science elective requirement might say “Choose two courses from Group 3” and then list 8 possible courses (the student can take any two). ASSIST’s data model captures the number N (e.g. n_courses: 2 for select 2).
Display of “No Articulation” cases: When a university course has no articulated equivalent at the community college, ASSIST explicitly shows “No course articulated.” Visually, this appears in the Equivalent Options list for that UC course – typically as a line of text stating “No course articulated.” (In the modern UI it might be italicized or in plain text under that course). This is essentially a placeholder indicating that the community college offers no course that the university recognizes as equivalent for that requirement​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. For instance, if UCSD requires a specific upper-division or very specialized lower-division course that De Anza College doesn’t teach, the ASSIST agreement will list the UCSD course and, under “Equivalent at De Anza,” simply state “No course articulated”​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. In the structured data, such entries are marked with a flag ("no_articulation": true) and a dummy course entry labeled “No Course Articulated”. It’s important to note that “No course articulated” does not mean the requirement is waived – it means the student cannot fulfill that particular course at the community college and would likely have to take it after transfer. Counselors often clarify this to students. (ASSIST’s FAQ confirms this is the default when no articulation agreement exists for a course and advises students to consult a counselor or ASSIST data manager for details​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
.) Standards for Grouping and Formatting: The structuring of groups, sections, and logic on ASSIST is guided by statewide policies to ensure consistency. The Articulation System Stimulating Interinstitutional Student Transfer (ASSIST) underwent a modernization in 2019–2023 to standardize these displays​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. According to ASSIST, new design features include explicit group numbers, section letters, and clear conjunctions (AND/OR) to help users read agreements uniformly​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. While there isn’t a public “style manual” for how agreements are formatted, these conventions are built into the ASSIST publishing system used by articulation officers. The California Intersegmental Articulation Council (CIAC) publishes a Handbook of California Articulation Policies which classifies types of agreements (course-to-course, general ed, major prep, etc.) and provides some guidelines on articulation practices. For example, that handbook defines Lower Division Major Preparation Agreements as those that “specify courses at a sending institution that fulfill lower division requirements for a specific major at a receiving institution” and notes that such agreements are published on ASSIST by the receiving campus​

​
csusb.edu
. In practice, each university’s articulation officers decide how to group requirements when inputting them into ASSIST (following the system’s capabilities). The ASSIST software then enforces the standardized format – e.g. automatically labeling groups “1, 2, 3…” and sections “A, B, C…”, and including phrases like “Complete 2 courses from the following” or “Complete A or B” based on the chosen logic type. In summary, ASSIST articulations are structured hierarchically: Agreement → Groups (requirements) → Sections (sub-requirements or options) → Course articulations (with AND/OR logic as needed). This hierarchy is now clearly delineated on assist.org for ease of interpretation​

2. Agreement Types & Structural Differences
ASSIST displays several types of articulation agreements, primarily: Major Preparation agreements, General Education Breadth agreements, and (to a lesser extent) certain transfer admission pathways. Each of these has a slightly different structure and purpose:
Major-Specific Articulation Agreements: These list the lower-division courses required for a specific major at the university and how a given community college’s courses can fulfill those requirements. Major articulation agreements are typically organized by groups corresponding to major requirement categories. They often have a title indicating the major (e.g. “Computer Science B.S. – Major Preparation”) and then a list of groups for each requirement or set of requirements. In major agreements:
The grouping often aligns with the university’s curriculum for that major. For example, one group might be “Mathematics Requirements” (listing calculus, linear algebra, etc.), another group might be “Science electives”, another “Major core courses.” Each group then shows the UC course(s) and the CCC equivalents.
Display logic: Major agreements frequently involve complex logic: AND chains for multi-course sequences and OR options for alternatives. The interface shows these clearly (discussed more in section 3). In a major agreement, it’s common to see phrases like “Complete the following courses…” (for a list of all required courses) or “Complete one of the following options…” if the student can choose between alternatives (e.g. different course sequences or tracks).
Honors courses: If the community college offers honors versions of courses, these are included as interchangeable options. They appear as separate lines or options but satisfy the same requirement (e.g., “MATH 1B or MATH 1BH” for a second-semester Calculus).
Granularity of metadata: Major agreements list specific course equivalencies with course codes, full titles, and often unit values for each course. This level of detail helps students match courses exactly. Additional notes may be present in major agreements, such as minimum grade requirements (if a university requires a certain grade for the course to count) or footnotes about sequence completion. The modern ASSIST system also allows articulation officers to include advisories or instructions at the top of the major agreement (e.g. disclaimers about impaction or recommendations to complete certain courses) – as seen in our case study JSON where a “General Advice” section precedes the course list.
General Education (GE) Agreements (IGETC and CSU GE-Breadth): These agreements show how a community college’s courses satisfy the broad general education requirements for transfer. Structurally, GE agreements are organized by Requirement Areas rather than specific university courses. For example, an IGETC agreement is divided into Areas 1 through 6 (Area 1: English Communication, Area 2: Mathematical Concepts, etc.), and a CSU GE agreement is divided into Areas A through E. Each area is effectively a group with a title (often the area name and a short description of what’s required).
Grouping/section structure: Each GE Area is typically treated as a group. Within each area, there may be further subdivisions. For instance, IGETC Area 1 (English Communication) has sub-requirements 1A, 1B, 1C (for UC, Area 1C is required only for CSU). ASSIST may represent these as separate sections or simply list them in sequence. A CSU GE example: Area A (English Language Communication and Critical Thinking) might be split into A1 (Oral Communication), A2 (Written Communication), A3 (Critical Thinking) – each of those sub-area requirements will be listed, usually with the rule “Complete 1 course from the following” under each sub-heading.
Display logic: GE agreements primarily use “select 1 course” or “select N courses” logic for each category. For example, the agreement will clearly state something like “Area A1 – Oral Communication: Select 1 course from the following:” then list the community college’s courses that are approved for Area A1. In IGETC Area 5 (Physical and Biological Sciences), the requirement might be phrased as “Select 2 courses, one from Physical Sciences and one from Biological Sciences” – ASSIST may break this into two subgroups or use explanatory text. (Often Area 5 is shown as Area 5A and 5B separately, each “select 1 course,” plus a note about the lab requirement.) The modern ASSIST format has improved clarity by explicitly stating the number of courses needed per area​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
.
Honors courses: Honors versions of GE courses are listed alongside regular versions. For instance, if History 17 and History 17H both satisfy IGETC Area 3B, both will appear on the list of options for Area 3B (usually as separate bullet points).
Metadata granularity: GE lists tend to be exhaustive lists of course options. They usually include course titles, and sometimes units, but no specific university course is referenced (since the “receiving” side is the GE area itself). Instead of a UC course name, you’ll see the requirement name. There are typically fewer notes in these lists since the rules are straightforward (“take one from this list”). However, some GE agreements have footnotes for certain courses (e.g. indicating a course that meets the Area 1C oral communication requirement for CSU but not applicable to UC, or noting that a course is no longer offered after a certain term). The ASSIST FAQ notes that most old footnotes on GE lists were phased out, but any critical footnotes are now included via links or notes at the top of the list​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
 (for example, clarifying things like the American Institutions requirement or special conditions).
Transfer Admission Guarantees (TAGs) and Other Pathways: Unlike major or GE articulation, TAG agreements (and programs like UCLA’s TAP or UCSD’s UniversityLink) are not primarily course-to-course articulation agreements; rather, they are contractual conditions for admission (often requiring completion of certain courses, a minimum GPA, and sometimes specific GE completion). These are generally not displayed as separate agreements on ASSIST. ASSIST focuses on course articulation, not admission policies. However, the courses one must complete as part of a TAG are usually exactly those found in the major prep articulation or GE lists. In practice, counselors and students use ASSIST to identify the required courses, and then consult TAG criteria (from the university’s TAG documentation) to see GPA and other requirements. ASSIST may sometimes include general text in a major agreement alluding to admissions pathways – for example, an ASSIST major articulation page might have a note like “This major is part of the Transfer Admission Guarantee program; consult campus admissions for GPA requirements,” but the specifics of GPA or application deadlines won’t be listed on ASSIST.
Structural differences: There is no special “TAG” articulation report on assist.org. If a community college and a UC have a TAG for, say, Psychology B.A., the courses required for the TAG are simply the major prep courses (and possibly certain GE patterns) which you can find via the major agreement and GE agreement. The TAG agreements themselves (the signed contracts specifying GPA etc.) are managed outside of ASSIST (usually through the UC’s TAG application portal and the community college’s transfer center). Therefore, ASSIST does not visually distinguish TAG requirements aside from providing the course articulation that underlies them.
That said, some admission-based pathways information can appear in ASSIST’s narrative sections. For example, ASSIST allows a “General Advice” or overview text at the top of major agreements. In some cases, universities use this to mention important things like “This major is highly selective. Completion of all listed courses with a minimum GPA of 3.5 is expected for admission.” These notes come from the articulation officers or UC admissions/articulation offices. For instance, in the UCSD Computer Science agreement, the overview text mentions the major is impacted and refers students to the department website for full information. Another example: some UC TAG-related notes might mention if a course double-counts for major and GE or if IGETC is recommended. But ASSIST will not list something like “GPA >= 3.4” as a requirement – that is outside the scope of articulation.
Honors TAP: Programs like UCLA’s Transfer Alliance Program (TAP), which give priority admission to students who complete an honors program at their CCC, also are not reflected in ASSIST agreements. TAP mainly requires completing an honors curriculum (which overlaps with GE/major courses). Again, ASSIST helps by showing which courses equate, but it won’t indicate which courses are considered “honors certified” for TAP – that info comes from the college’s honors program.
Differences in Representation:
Major vs GE: Major agreements map specific university courses (or requirements) to CCC courses, whereas GE agreements map broad area requirements to CCC courses. Thus, major agreements will name university department courses (e.g. “UCSD CSE 12 – Basic Data Structures” → “De Anza CIS 22C or 22CH”), while GE agreements will name areas (e.g. “IGETC Area 4 – Social and Behavioral Sciences: Anthropology 2 or Economics 1 or History 17, etc.”). Major agreements often involve mixed logic (some courses all required, some either/or options, some choice of electives) and can be quite complex, whereas GE agreements are often simpler in logic (usually “1 from group” or “2 from group”) but longer in list of options.
Use of Sections: Major agreements commonly use section lettering to denote alternate sets of courses (as in our case study, where Section A vs B distinguished different course sequences). GE agreements use sections less frequently except to break out sub-areas. For example, you might see “Area 5: Physical and Biological Sciences” split into Section A: Physical Science and Section B: Biological Science if needed, each with its own list. If a GE area has multiple parts (like CSU American Institutions has US History, US Government, CA Government requirements), those might be listed as separate sections or simply separate bullet groups under that area.
Honors Handling: Both major and GE agreements treat honors courses similarly by listing them as alternate options. In a major agreement, an honors course at CCC that covers the same content as the non-honors will articulate the same and will be shown as an OR option under the UC course. In a GE list, the honors version is listed on equal footing next to the regular version in the area. There is no special indicator beyond the course title or code itself having “H” or “- HONORS” to show it’s an honors course. In other words, ASSIST doesn’t give extra weight to honors in the articulation display; it simply ensures they appear as acceptable alternatives. (Completion of honors might matter for programs like TAP, but that is outside the ASSIST display.)
Metadata and Notes: Major agreements might include more contextual information (like introductory text, or footnotes about sequences – e.g. “student must take the entire sequence for credit” if partial credit isn’t given). GE agreements historically had footnotes (e.g. a # to mark new additions, or notes about Area 6 language requirement fulfillment). The new system has minimized footnotes. The ASSIST FAQ notes that any additional notes for GE will be provided as a link or text at the top if needed​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. Major agreements might note things like effective term changes (e.g. “Course X articulates to Course Y effective Fall 2022”) if there was a recent curriculum update – these notes often appear inline next to the course in older PDFs. In the new HTML format, such temporal articulation notes might appear as annotations or separate lines (the modernization removed the old practice of footnote symbols embedded in text, opting for clearer presentation).
Summary: Major articulation agreements are tailored to specific bachelor’s programs and thus tend to have more complex structure (mirroring the major’s prep requirements: core courses, sequences, options). GE agreements are standardized by area and thus more uniform in structure across all institutions (every IGETC Area 1 will look similar for any CCC). TAG/admissions agreements aren’t explicitly shown as separate structures on ASSIST; instead, their course requirements are covered by the major/GE articulation, with any non-course requirements handled outside ASSIST. ASSIST’s modernization has made all these agreement types more consistent in look and feel than in the past, but the content organization differs as noted. The key difference is what is being articulated: individual courses for majors vs categories of courses for GE vs conditions for TAG (the last of which you glean indirectly).
3. Visual & Logical Representation on ASSIST
ASSIST uses a combination of textual cues and subtle visual elements (color codes, arrows, indentations) to convey AND/OR logic in articulation agreements. Understanding these visual conventions is crucial to interpreting the requirements correctly:
AND logic (courses that must be taken together): When a university course can be satisfied only by a combination of two or more community college courses, ASSIST indicates this grouping clearly. In the modern interface, multiple courses that together equal one requirement are typically indented or connected with a bracket or arrow and an “AND” label. For example, if UC Irvine requires “Physics 7C” and at Pasadena City College that is fulfilled by taking Physics 1A AND 1B (two courses), ASSIST would list those two PCC courses together, usually with some connector. In many cases, a small colored arrow or line connects the two course names, and a green icon or text “AND” is displayed to the left, signaling that both courses are required jointly. The modernization project explicitly added “expanded conjunction display options” – i.e. clearer visual markers for AND​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. So instead of the old PDF style of just parentheses, the new ASSIST might show an AND tag or bracket linking the courses. Users have noted, for instance, green arrows or bars connecting courses that are part of one set. The color highlights draw attention to the fact those courses function as a package.
OR logic (alternative options): When there are alternative courses or sets of courses that fulfill the same requirement, ASSIST typically lists them as separate bullet points or separate lines, prefaced by the word “OR”. In the current interface, you might see something like a list:
Course A at CCC
OR Course B at CCC
OR Course C at CCC
This indicates the student can take any one of those options. Sometimes the “OR” is written in text; other times it’s implied by the list format (with each option separated by a horizontal line or an “OR” label between lines). In complex cases (like an OR between an individual course and a pair of courses), ASSIST nestles the options appropriately. For example, “CIS 35A OR (CIS 36A AND CIS 36B)” might be displayed with CIS 35A as one bullet, and then CIS 36A and 36B indented together as another bullet, with an OR connector between the first bullet and the indented block. The use of color might differ: some users report seeing purple/blue arrows to denote alternate pathways. The general idea is that each distinct option is visually separated. In older formats, ASSIST would literally write “OR” between lines; the new format might use a graphic indicator. Regardless, the presence of multiple listed options under the same UC requirement implies an OR relationship unless explicitly joined by “AND.”
Nested combinations (AND within OR options): The UI is designed to handle cases where an option itself consists of multiple courses. As described, one option could be a single course, and another option could be a set of two courses. ASSIST will indent and group the two-course set and likely apply a bracket or connecting arrow to show those two are taken together, then label that whole group as one option, parallel to the single-course option. Visually, this might look like:
Option 1: Course X
(no indent, a single line)
OR
Option 2:
→ Course Y
→ Course Z
(with an “AND” connecting Y and Z). The arrow “→” here denotes indentation/connection. The actual site might show a colored vertical bar or bracket tying Y and Z, with a small “AND” between them, and the word “OR” between Option 1 and Option 2 group. This essentially renders a logical tree: Option2 requires Y AND Z.
Visualization of Group and Section structure: Each group of requirements on ASSIST is usually delineated by a header or a number. For example, you might see a purple banner or bold line that says “1 Complete 1 course from the following” (for a GE area or an elective requirement)​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. The group number is often shown in a colored box or alongside the instruction. Section letters (A, B, etc.) may be indicated at the start of lines or in the instructions (e.g. “Complete A or B” at the group header level, and then each section labeled “Section A:” and “Section B:” in the text). Visually, sections might be separated by subtle shading or an extra line break to show they are distinct sets. The color scheme introduced in the modernization uses bold colors (often purple headers for group titles, and a different accent for AND/OR symbols). For instance, a green “AND” tag might be used to connect courses in an AND sequence, while blue or purple arrow icons might denote an OR branching. The exact colors aside, the key is that ASSIST now uses iconography and indentation to eliminate ambiguity that existed in the plain text era​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
.
Honors courses representation: Honors courses are shown with their own course codes (often with an H suffix) and titles, just like any other course. ASSIST does not give them a special color or note beyond marking them as “HONORS” in the title. For example, “MATH 2BH – Linear Algebra – HONORS” will appear right below “MATH 2B – Linear Algebra” as an alternative for the same requirement. In the JSON example from De Anza->UCSD, we see honors courses have "honors": true and are listed in separate option lines. On screen, a student would just see the two course options separated by “OR.” Both are acceptable; there’s no additional text explaining that one is honors – it’s presumed clear from the course code/title. (Thus, visually they look nearly identical except for the “H” or “- HONORS” label).
Courses appearing in multiple groups or sections: In some agreements, the same community college course might be listed in more than one place if it can fulfill multiple requirements. ASSIST doesn’t cross-reference within an agreement – it will list the course wherever relevant. For instance, Psychology 1 at Santa Monica College might satisfy a major requirement for a UC Psych major and also appear in the IGETC Area 4 list. In each context it’s shown independently. Within a single major agreement, it’s less common for one CCC course to appear twice, because each university course requirement is usually distinct. One scenario, though, is if a university course is cross-listed (say a UC course is listed under two departments), the CCC equivalent might be listed once under each UC course code. ASSIST would show both, effectively duplicating the CCC course in two places with the respective UC course labels. There isn’t a special visual indicator saying “this CCC course was already mentioned in Group 1” or anything – it’s up to the user to notice. Counselors are usually aware and will tell the student that course X satisfies both requirements but will only count once. (ASSIST itself doesn’t handle degree audit nuances like double-counting; it just shows articulation per requirement.)
“Select 2 courses from the following” logic: When a group has a rule like “select N courses,” the interface will present the list of eligible courses, often with checkboxes or bullet points, but it relies on the text instruction to tell the user how many to choose. For example, “Group 3: Select 2 courses from the following” might be a bold instruction, and then underneath, nine courses are listed. Visually, the list may not inherently highlight any two – it’s up to the user to know they need any two. There is no dynamic feature that picks them for you; it’s informational. However, each course in that list might itself have multiple lines if needed (like the BILD 1 example where each option is a set of three CCC courses – see next section). The number N is clearly indicated in the group instruction (e.g. “2 courses”), so users should notice it. In older PDF agreements, this was sometimes buried in notes, but now it’s upfront in bold text. So the visual emphasis is on the instruction line.
Nested OR + AND chains: As discussed, ASSIST can nest logic. The visual representation is essentially a combination of the above techniques. Think of it as a tree: an OR at a higher level splits into branches, and an AND ties things within a branch. The site might use indentations to show hierarchy. For example, a requirement might read: “Complete one of the following options:” and then be followed by two section labels (A and B). The content under A could list multiple courses (with “AND” connectors), and the content under B could list one or more courses. The presence of section labels already cues the OR (A vs B). Inside Section A, if multiple courses are listed without an OR, that implies AND (all required in that section). To reinforce that, ASSIST’s UI draws connectors between them. In Section B if there’s just one course listed, no connector needed. In summary: nested logic is conveyed through a combination of section headers, indentation, and connector labels. Users might see something like a bracket encompassing two course names with an “AND” tag, next to another bracket with another course or courses, all under an umbrella of “either A or B.” The modern interface was designed to make this as clear as possible (using bold lines, arrows, and tags instead of the old textual indentation that could be confusing)​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
.
Cross-listed courses or courses in multiple majors: If a course is cross-listed (for example, Sociology 30 and Psychology 30 are the same course at the CCC), ASSIST will typically list whichever prefix the articulation agreement was entered under. Sometimes the articulation officer will list both prefixes with a slash (e.g. “SOC 30 / PSY 30”) if they want to be explicit. More often, one prefix is designated as the primary. Visually, it will appear as a single line with that course. Students are generally expected to know from their college catalog that the course is cross-listed. ASSIST does not have a special symbol for cross-listed courses; it treats them as separate courses unless manually noted. As a result, a cross-listed course might even appear twice in an agreement under each code if not coordinated. (This is a nuance where counselors may clarify any confusion.) As for a course appearing in multiple majors: ASSIST shows each major agreement separately, so there’s no direct visual link across different majors. But if two majors require the same course, each major’s page will list that articulation. For example, Foothill College’s Math 1A (Calculus I) will show up on the Math major prep page, the Physics major prep page, Engineering major page, etc., each time mapping to the respective UC’s calculus course. The representation in each case is identical (since it’s the same articulation rule), just repeated on different pages.
In essence, ASSIST’s visual design now closely mirrors logical groupings: AND groups are literally bracketed or tagged as such, OR options are separated and/or labeled, and instructions are given in plain language at the group or section level. Users have reported that the new ASSIST interface uses colored arrows and lines to make these relations intuitive (for example, green “AND” connectors and purple “OR” separators), which aligns with the stated goal of improved clarity for conjunctions​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. While it may take a moment for new users to get used to the layout, the combination of text instructions (“or”, “and”, “select 2”) and visual grouping ensures that the logical structure of requirements is unambiguous.
4. Case Study: De Anza College → UC San Diego (Computer Science B.S.)
To illustrate the above concepts, let’s analyze a specific articulation agreement: De Anza College → UC San Diego, B.S. in Computer Science (2024–2025). This agreement is a rich example, as it contains all three logic structures (alternate sections, all-required sequences, and a “select N” list). We will break down how many groups/sections it has and highlight a few specific requirements:
Overall structure (Groups & Sections): The UCSD CSE major articulation is divided into at least three major groups:
Group 1 – This group covers the introductory programming requirement. It has 2 sections, A and B, with an instruction “Complete A or B”. In other words, Group 1 presents two alternative paths to satisfy the same requirement. Section A corresponds to UCSD’s standard two-course introductory sequence (CSE 8A and CSE 8B), while Section B corresponds to the accelerated one-course option (CSE 11).
Group 2 – This group includes the bulk of the lower-division major courses (data structures, architecture, math, etc.). The instruction for Group 2 is “N/A” (no special choice), meaning all listed courses are required. However, for clarity, the agreement splits these into Section A and Section B (even though it’s not an OR situation). Section A contains the CSE department courses (beyond intro) that UCSD requires for the major (like CSE 12, 15L, 20, 21, 30), and Section B contains the required math courses (Math 18, 20A, 20B, 20C). The use of sections here is purely organizational – the student must complete both section A and B in Group 2 since the group logic is “all_required”. (They likely separated them to group CSE vs MATH requirements for readability.)
Group 3 – This group is labeled with an instruction like “Select 2 courses from the following.” It lists a set of science courses (options include UCSD’s BILD 1, BILD 2, BILD 3 – biology series; CHEM 6A, 6B – general chemistry; PHYS 2A, 2B or the calculus-based PHYS 4A, 4B). All these courses are in Section A (only one section for Group 3) because they are all part of one pool. The student can choose any two courses out of this list to satisfy UCSD’s science elective requirement for the CS major.
In summary, Group 1 has 2 sections (A, B), Group 2 has 2 sections (A, B) but functions as all-required, Group 3 has 1 section (A). Yes, all three logic types appear across these three groups: Group 1 is a choose_one_section scenario, Group 2 is all_required, Group 3 is select_n_courses (n=2).
Example 1 – CSE 11 requirement (Group 1, Section B): UCSD’s CSE 11 is an accelerated introductory programming course that covers in one quarter what CSE 8A and 8B cover in two quarters. The articulation shows this clearly. Group 1’s instruction “Complete A or B” means the student must either follow Section A or Section B. Section B is for CSE 11. Under Section B, it lists the De Anza equivalents as:
Option 1: CIS 35A – Java Programming
OR Option 2: CIS 36A AND CIS 36B (Introduction to Java AND Intermediate Java).
Visually on ASSIST, Section B would have something like:
CSE 11 (Intro to Programming – Accelerated) – Equivalent Options:
CIS 35A
OR (CIS 36A AND CIS 36B).
This articulation encapsulates an AND within an OR: De Anza offers two ways to get the content of CSE 11 – either take their single-course Java class CIS 35A, or take the two-course Java sequence (36A + 36B). If the student plans to transfer, they can satisfy CSE 11 by doing either. The presence of “AND” tells us both CIS 36A and 36B together count as one option. The blue arrow/green AND visual would likely connect CIS 36A and CIS 36B on the screen, indicating they come as a pair. Meanwhile, an “OR” separator would be shown between that pair and CIS 35A. This is a classic example of ASSIST handling a bundled course sequence versus single course alternative. From a student perspective: if they have already taken CIS 36A and 36B at De Anza, they’ve essentially done the equivalent of UCSD’s CSE 11 (and thus also CSE 8A/8B). Or if they took CIS 35A, that alone covers it. They do not need to do both options – one or the other suffices, as dictated by the group logic “A or B” (here, Section B is chosen instead of Section A).
Example 2 – MATH 20C requirement (Group 2, Section B): UCSD’s Math 20C (Calculus III – multivariable calculus) provides a good example of articulation where a full sequence at the CCC is needed for one UC course. In Group 2, Section B lists UCSD Math 18, 20A, 20B, 20C as required math courses. For Math 20C, the articulation shows:
MATH 20C (Calculus and Analytic Geometry for Science and Engineering) – Equivalent Options:
(De Anza Math 1C AND Math 1D) OR
(De Anza Math 1CH AND Math 1DH).
This means UCSD’s single course Math 20C corresponds to completing two quarter courses at De Anza (since De Anza splits the multivariable calculus material into two parts, Math 1C and 1D; similarly an honors sequence 1CH + 1DH). On ASSIST, these would likely be displayed as two bullet options for Math 20C:
Math 1C + 1D (with an AND connector)
OR Math 1CH + 1DH (with an AND connector, and perhaps an indication those are honors).
There is no single-course option here; either regular or honors sequence must be completed. This is a “select one full AND path out of two options” scenario, as the question describes. It’s effectively an OR between two AND sets. The logic type for Group 2 is still “all_required” at the group level (since the student needs Math 20A, 20B, 20C all fulfilled), but within Math 20C’s articulation, ASSIST applies an internal OR for the two possible sequences. Notably, all three of the Math courses 20A, 20B, 20C had similar patterns:
Math 20A mapped to Math 1A OR 1AH (just one-to-one course, or honors).
Math 20B mapped to Math 1B OR 1BH.
Math 20C mapped to (Math 1C + 1D) OR (Math 1CH + 1DH). Each of those had to be completed, so the student at De Anza ends up taking Math 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D (or honors equivalents) to cover Math 20A/B/C. The articulation faithfully represents that with the necessary AND/OR connections. If a student were to take only Math 1C and not 1D, ASSIST would show that Math 20C is not fully satisfied – both are required as indicated. There’s no partial credit: the articulation is an all-or-nothing bundle (and ASSIST would likely footnote if partial completion had any credit, but typically it doesn’t for sequences like this).
Example 3 – BILD 1 requirement (Group 3, Science electives): Group 3 has the instruction “Select 2 courses from the following.” The UCSD courses in this group include BILD 1, BILD 2, BILD 3 (biology series), CHEM 6A, CHEM 6B (general chem series), PHYS 2A, 2B and PHYS 4A, 4B (physics series). The student needs to complete any two of these UC courses’ equivalents. Here we see an interesting articulation case with bundled ANDs inside a select-N context:
For BILD 1 (Cell Biology): De Anza’s equivalent isn’t a single course, because De Anza teaches biology as a full three-quarter sequence (Bio 6A, 6B, 6C). ASSIST shows BILD 1 can be satisfied by either:
(BIOL 6A + 6B + 6C) OR
(BIOL 6AH + 6B + 6CH).
In other words, the entire series of three courses is required to get credit for UCSD’s BILD 1. (The honors option is an honors first quarter and third quarter, with the same middle course 6B in common.)
Similarly, BILD 2 (Multicellular Life) lists the same De Anza combination (6A+6B+6C or honors variant) as fulfilling it, and BILD 3 (Organismic/Evolutionary Bio) also lists 6A+6B+6C (or honors). This indicates that De Anza’s Bio 6ABC sequence, when completed in its entirety, is considered equivalent to all three of UCSD’s BILD 1,2,3 courses. But UCSD splits them, and ASSIST dutifully repeats the combo under each BILD course.
For the other courses in Group 3: CHEM 6A at UCSD maps to CHEM 1A OR 1AH at De Anza (one course, since De Anza’s Chem 1A covers first-quarter chem). CHEM 6B maps to CHEM 1B or 1BH (second-quarter chem)​
file-36zfp3tfkq7kqme7kdw4hl
. PHYS 2A (algebra-based physics) maps to PHYS 4A (calc-based physics) at De Anza? Actually, this one is interesting: De Anza offers PHYS 2A (a trig-based physics) and PHYS 4A (calc-based). UCSD has separate sequences for PHYS 2 vs PHYS 4. In the agreement, they listed both PHYS 2 and PHYS 4 series courses as options. For PHYS 2A (UCSD’s algebra-based mechanics), De Anza’s PHYS 4A (calc-based mechanics) is listed as an equivalent option​
file-36zfp3tfkq7kqme7kdw4hl
 – implying De Anza’s calculus-based physics also satisfies the algebra-based requirement (likely accepted as higher). PHYS 2B (UCSD) would similarly accept PHYS 4B (De Anza). So each UCSD course in the list has an articulation, some one-to-one, some one-to-many.
Now, how does the “select 2” work with these? Essentially, UCSD says: among those 9 courses (BILD 1,2,3; CHEM 6A,6B; PHYS 2A,2B,4A,4B – although note PHYS 4A/4B are actually the same requirement as 2A/2B pairs, just different sequence), a student needs to have credit for any two of them. In practice, an ASSIST user might see all nine listed with their De Anza equivalents. The student could mix and match. For example, they could choose to take General Chemistry 1 & 2 (CHEM 1A and 1B at De Anza) which would cover UCSD’s CHEM 6A and 6B – that’s two courses, fulfilling the requirement. Or they could take the full biology series (6A/B/C) at De Anza, which would give them credit for BILD 1, 2, 3 – that’s actually three UCSD courses; having at least two of those would more than fulfill the requirement. Or any other combination of two. The critical point: Group 3 doesn’t require all listed courses, just any two. So ASSIST’s logic type is select_n_courses with n=2. Are there implicit sections nested here? Group 3 has only Section A containing all options. Within that, each UC course has its own articulation line(s). You might think of each UC course as a sub-requirement, but ASSIST did not label them as separate sections B, C, etc. They remain under one umbrella (Section A) with the group instruction guiding the selection. For instance, BILD 1, BILD 2, BILD 3 are all part of Section A – they aren’t separated into different sections because they’re not mutually exclusive alternatives; they are part of the pool. The student can choose any two across the entire pool. So the grouping is flat in that sense. One could ask: do you have to take all of BIOL 6A+B+6C to count as one of the two courses? Yes – completing that trio at De Anza would give you credit for BILD 1 (and also BILD 2 and 3, actually). But if you only did part of the trio (say BIOL 6A & 6B but not 6C), you wouldn’t get credit for any of the BILDs – those would all show “No” because the articulation requires the full set. ASSIST shows the requirement clearly: the three courses are bracketed together with an AND, and that entire bracket is just to satisfy one BILD course. This is an example of an “all-or-nothing” sequence bundled as an option. It’s implicit that partial completion doesn’t count (and indeed it’s not counted as fulfilling “two courses” until the whole set yields a UC course credit). Thus for Group 3, the student should likely choose two options that are easier to achieve. Many students might pick CHEM 6A and 6B (since each needs one CCC course) or PHYS 4A and 4B. If a student really wants biology, they’d have to do the whole series – but doing so technically gives them three UC courses, which is above and beyond the “two” required. ASSIST doesn’t stop you from exceeding the requirement, but at least two must be done. This example underscores how ASSIST presents the info neutrally; the student (or counselor or a tool like TransferAI) must deduce the optimal strategy (which two to take).
Implicit vs explicit sections: The question asks if there are implicit section types without labeled sections (e.g., nested within Group 3). In Group 3, we saw nested logic (the Bio series within each BILD) but they are not given separate section labels like A, B, C, because they are all under Section A. The only time sections (with letters) appear is when the group-level logic calls for distinct alternatives. In Group 3, everything is part of one selection pool, so no separate section letters are needed – each course’s alternatives are handled in-line. One might say there are “mini-sections” for each UC course (like BILD 1 has two options: regular vs honors sequence), but formally those aren’t called sections in ASSIST terms; they’re just alternative articulation options for that course. So yes, there are nested alternatives but not labeled as Sections B, C, etc. Another way to put it: Section labels (A, B…) only denote parallel paths to fulfill a whole requirement group, not different ways to fulfill sub-parts. Inside a section, any OR/AND is just shown by indenting and “AND/OR” text, not new section labels.
Comparison with other major articulation pages structurally: The De Anza→UCSD CS agreement is somewhat complex because of the alternate intro (Group 1) and the elective choices (Group 3). Many other majors have simpler structures:
Some majors might have no alternate sections at all – for example, a UCSD Biology major might simply require a set list of courses (all required, group after group for different categories like math, chem, physics, bio) without any “choose A or B.” In that case, you’d see no “Complete A or B” instructions, just groups of required courses.
Some majors have alternate pathways similar to Group 1. For instance, UCLA Chemistry might allow students to take either a standard calculus series or a combined calculus course – which would appear as a “choose one section” between two math sequences. Or a UC might accept either Physics sequence (algebra-based vs calculus-based) for certain majors, which could be shown as Section A vs B for the physics requirement.
The “select N courses” pattern (Group 3) is a bit less common in major prep, but it does appear especially for majors that require science electives or “choose one of these constrained electives.” Another example: some UC humanities majors require “2 courses in Literature from the following list” – which would be a similar select-N group. Not all majors have that; many just list specific courses. So the presence of Group 3 in this CS articulation is because UCSD’s CS major expects two science courses of the student’s choice from a list. Another campus might simply require a specific pair (like “take Physics 2A and 2B, period,” which would then be listed as required courses rather than a selection).
Structurally, every major articulation page will use groups and sections in the same way – the formatting rules are consistent across institutions​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. What varies is how many groups and whether multiple sections are needed. The De Anza→UCSD CS page used 3 groups. Another major might have a different number: e.g., UC Berkeley English might have, say, 2 groups (Group 1: English composition requirements, Group 2: Literature survey requirements) each with a list of courses all required or some choices. A CSU engineering articulation might have 4 groups (math, science, engineering core, GE considerations). But the concept of group numbering and possible sectioning is the same. In the De Anza→UCSD CS case, we indeed saw all three logic types in one agreement, which is somewhat representative of a complex STEM major at a UC. A simpler major (like History) might only use all_required and maybe a select_n for electives, but no alternate sections needed. A highly flexible major might use more selectives. An impacted or very interdisciplinary major might have multiple alternative paths (sections) if the university allows different tracks.
In summary, the case study shows how ASSIST can handle:
Multiple Groups (each addressing a category of requirements, numbered 1, 2, 3).
Sections A/B to offer completely different routes (Group 1: normal vs accelerated programming).
AND sequences (CIS 36A + 36B) as part of an OR option (with CIS 35A).
Select 2 of N scenario (Group 3).
Honors vs regular alternatives (Math and Bio sequences).
No articulation cases (Group 2 had CSE 15L and CSE 21 with “No course articulated” – those are worth noting: De Anza had no course for UCSD’s CSE 15L and CSE 21, and ASSIST showed “No course articulated” for those entries. Visually, that likely appeared as a dash or a line stating no course, signaling the student will have to take those at UCSD).
The De Anza→UCSD structure is not unusual for a UC engineering/computer science major. If we compared it to, say, Pasadena City College → UCSD CS, the content would differ only in the CCC course codes, but we’d likely see the same pattern: Group 1 (CSE 8 vs 11 options), Group 2 (all required core), Group 3 (science electives). If we compare to a different major at UCSD, like De Anza→UCSD Psychology, we might see fewer groups (perhaps one group for major courses, one for statistics requirement, one for electives). Each page is tailored, but they all obey the same structural logic system.
5. Cross-CCC and Cross-UC Analysis
To ensure our model generalizes, we should examine how articulation agreements might vary between different community colleges and universities, as well as different majors (STEM vs non-STEM). We’ll consider examples involving Foothill College, Pasadena City College, Santa Monica College (all top CCCs, with Foothill/De Anza on quarter system and PCC/SMC on semester system) and UC campuses like UC Irvine, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley. Let’s highlight patterns and differences: Structural Consistency: Thanks to ASSIST’s standardized format, the basic structure (groups, sections, logic types) remains consistent across CCC→UC agreements. No matter the college or university, if you open a major agreement for 2024–2025, you’ll see numbered groups with possibly section letters, and clear indications of AND/OR. The modernization ensures “increased consistency for agreements across all institutions”​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. Thus, a student looking at a Psychology agreement from Santa Monica to UCLA will see a format similar to a Psychology agreement from Pasadena to UC Davis – albeit the content (courses and specifics) differ. Differences by Community College System (quarter vs semester): One notable variation can be how many CCC courses are required to cover a university course, depending on the CCC’s academic calendar:
Quarter-system CCCs (like Foothill/De Anza) often align more one-to-one with UC quarter courses. For example, UC Davis’ MAT 21A (Calculus I) might correspond to Foothill’s MATH 1A (Calculus I) – both quarter length.
Semester-system CCCs (like Pasadena City, Santa Monica) cover more content in one course. For instance, UCSD’s Math 20A and 20B (two quarter courses) might both be satisfied by Santa Monica’s Math 7 (a single semester Calculus II that covers the material of Calc II and III). If a single CCC course covers two UC courses worth of material, how does ASSIST handle it? Typically, ASSIST will articulate that one CCC course to each of the UC courses individually if appropriate. But often, universities prefer sequences to be completed. For example, UC Berkeley’s Calculus requirement might say “Math 1A and 1B at Berkeley = Math 3A and 3B at Santa Monica” (one-to-one, since both are semester pairs). However, UCSD’s example: perhaps one semester of physics at a CC equals two quarters at UCSD – ASSIST might list that semester course as the equivalent for both quarter courses (or list one as equivalent and the second UC course as “no articulation (credit given via sequence)”). The details can vary. The key point: quarter vs semester can introduce cases of many-to-one or one-to-many mappings. ASSIST is capable of showing those via AND groups. For instance, if PCC’s single course covers two UC courses, ASSIST might require that single course plus perhaps something else like a lab to equal both – or it might simply list that course under each UC course. Generally, UCs try to avoid giving double credit for one CCC course, so they may instead articulate it to one UC course and consider the rest as “content overlap.” This could result in “No articulation” for the second UC course, with a note that the CCC course already covered it. These nuances might not be explicitly clear on ASSIST without notes. But on the whole, the structural tools (AND/OR) are flexible enough for both quarter and semester mappings.
Differences by Discipline (STEM vs Non-STEM):
STEM Majors (e.g. Mechanical Engineering, Psychology B.S. if heavy science): STEM prep often involves long sequences (Chemistry, Physics, Math) and thus more instances of AND logic bundling and cross-sequence alternatives. Mechanical Engineering agreements, for example, usually require full calculus, physics, and chemistry sequences – which at semester schools might be straightforward (one CCC course per requirement) but at quarter schools or when mixing calendars might have the “complete sequence” notes. Also, engineering majors sometimes allow different science electives (similar to the CS example’s Group 3). We might see “choose 1 engineering elective from these 3 courses” for some majors, which would use a select_n structure.
Another STEM example: Psychology (B.A. vs B.S.) – a Psychology B.A. at a UC might have mostly social science courses and a math/stats requirement, whereas a Psychology B.S. could require biology and chemistry. So a Psych B.S. articulation (say Foothill College → UC Davis Psychology B.S.) might include a group “Biological Science Requirement: choose one – BIOL 1 or BIOL 14 or PSYC 30 (physiological psych)” depending on what the UC accepts. Psychology is interesting because some UCs let you choose between biology or an extra psychology course. That would appear as a group with sections or an OR list (e.g. “Complete one of the following courses: BIOL 10 or PSY 2”). The structure for a non-engineering STEM like Psychology is typically simpler than engineering: fewer total courses, maybe one or two choices.
Mechanical Engineering (say Pasadena City → UC Irvine): One would expect an all_required list of courses: calculus, differential equations, physics, chemistry, engineering introductory courses (circuits, statics, etc.). Often no electives in lower division – you must do all. There could be alternate sequences (like UCI might accept either Physics 8 series or 2 series for engineers – if so, that’s a choose section A or B). Or possibly a choice between MATLAB programming vs C programming – which would be an OR. But largely, engineering agreements are “complete all of the following.” So structurally: likely multiple groups (Math group, Science group, Engineering group) but all required within each.
Computer Science we covered; other engineering (Electrical, Mechanical) would be analogous.
Non-STEM Majors (e.g. English, Film & Media Studies, Psychology B.A.): These often have fewer strict sequences and more flexibility in content:
English (Literature) major: Typically requires a sequence of English literature survey courses (like English Lit before 1800, after 1800, American Lit, etc.) and perhaps critical reading or a Shakespeare course. ASSIST for an English major (say Santa Monica College → UCLA English) might show groups like: Group 1: English Composition requirement (maybe 2 courses, often freshman comp which at CCC is English 1 plus a second composition or critical thinking course – those might actually appear as prerequisites but sometimes the major expects them too). Group 2: Literature survey requirements – e.g. “Complete 2 of the following 3 survey courses” (British Lit, American Lit, World Lit). That could be a select_n_courses = 2 out of list of 3, for example. Or it might list them in sections if UCLA says “take one British and one American.” If it’s specifically one of each category, they might break it into two groups or two sections: Section A: choose one from British lit list, Section B: choose one from American lit list. If it’s any two, they’d do one group with select 2. Then Group 3 might be something like “Additional recommended courses: (not required but if taken will satisfy X at UCLA)” – sometimes they include such notes for humanities.
Honors: Many CCCs have Honors versions of these lit courses; they’d be listed as OR options just like before.
Metadata: Likely straightforward, not many complex AND combos since lit courses tend to articulate one-to-one.
Film and Media Studies: This major might require a mix of art/history courses and some production courses. For example, UC Irvine’s Film & Media Studies B.A. articulation from Saddleback or Santa Monica might have something like: “Group 1: Critical Studies – take an intro to film course (the CCC’s ‘Film Appreciation’ course might articulate to UCI’s FMS 85A). Group 2: Production – optional or required one course in production (maybe an OR: take either “Filmmaking” or “Screenwriting” if available). Group 3: Electives – choose 2 courses from media-related electives (could include courses from various departments like history of film, media theory, etc.).” The structure could involve a select_n or just listing all if all needed. If the UC requires “two courses from category X,” ASSIST will mirror that. Film major prep often has fewer articulated courses because some content is unique; so you might also see “No course articulated” for some niche theory course.
Psychology (B.A.): Usually requires Intro to Psychology, a statistics course, maybe a biology or cognitive science course as options, and some social science electives. A pattern might be: Group 1: Intro Psych (one course, articulated one-to-one), Group 2: Research Methods/Statistics (maybe “Complete one: either Psych Statistics or Math Statistics” – an OR between PSYC 7 and MATH 10 at a CCC, for instance), Group 3: Breadth – “select 2 courses from the following list of psychology electives (developmental, social, etc.)”. Many UCs allow community college courses for some of these lower-division electives, but not all. So structure could include a select_n. If multiple categories need one each (like “one course in Social Psychology and one in Biology Psychology”), they might create two groups for each category. So either way, similar constructs.
Differences by Destination UC: Different UCs sometimes have different philosophies on articulation:
UC Irvine (UCI) often has very detailed articulation agreements, especially for majors like engineering and business, and they might allow some alternatives. For example, UCI might accept either a course in C++ or Java to satisfy a programming requirement – that would be an OR listing on ASSIST (if so, you’d see both courses as options). Another example: UCI’s Psychology might allow a CCC Biology course to count as a bio science elective for the Psych major, whereas UC Davis might instead just require a biology class as a separate requirement. These result in either an OR vs an all-required difference.
UC Davis (UCD) tends to have comprehensive articulation for science majors and often lists all courses needed. If a major is part of a Transfer Pathway or ADT (Associate Degree for Transfer) pattern, UC Davis might structure it to mirror that (e.g. they might explicitly say “students should complete the Chemistry series and either Physics or an extra biology” – which on ASSIST shows up as a choice).
UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) and UC San Diego (UCSD), being on quarter systems and having many transfers, often include selection lists for science majors similar to UCSD CS example (like UCSB might say “Chemistry majors: take two electives from physics, CS, etc.”).
UC Berkeley (UCB) – Berkeley historically has been a bit particular: some majors (especially in Letters & Science) do not pre-approve many lower-division courses beyond basics. For instance, UCB’s English major might not articulate a lot of sophomore literature courses, preferring students take them at UCB. So the articulation agreement for English at UCB might be short: it could just say “No articulated courses for the English major; see department for lower-division recommendations” (this can happen if the department doesn’t participate in articulation for major-specific courses). In contrast, UCB Psychology will accept things like Intro Psych, Statistics, etc. So one variation is that some UCs provide very full articulation agreements, while others have sparse ones if the department didn’t create any. In ASSIST, if a major agreement is unavailable, students might have to rely on department or course-to-course articulation. The FAQ notes that when major agreements aren’t published, ASSIST will show department articulation instead, which is just a list of course equivalencies by department without the context of which are required​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
.
For example, if we look for Film & Media Studies for UC Berkeley: Berkeley might not have a specific articulation for Film (hypothetically), and ASSIST might only have a list of which community college courses equal which UCB Film courses, but not say “take these for the major.” Other UCs like UCSB or UCI might have a clear list “these are the major prep courses.”
Patterns vs Variations:
Patterns that hold across disciplines: The use of groups for categories (major core, major electives, etc.) is common. The use of AND for sequences like year-long sequences is universal for science courses. The appearance of “No Course Articulated” typically happens in every discipline for at least some courses (most CCCs don’t have equivalents for certain specialized courses, whether it’s an engineering lab or a niche theory course in humanities)​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. The logic types are always one of the three; we haven’t seen any logic outside choose-one, all-required, or select-N in the ASSIST data – meaning every requirement is either “do all of these,” “do one of these sections,” or “choose N of these options.” This covers essentially all scenarios needed in articulation.
Variations by discipline: STEM tends to generate deeper chains (multiple ANDs in a row for long sequences) and sometimes optional paths (like different science sequences or different programming languages). Non-STEM often has broader selection lists (multiple acceptable electives where any subset will do) and fewer multi-course combinations (aside from maybe language courses for a foreign language requirement – e.g. an English major might require 4th semester foreign language, which at a CCC is often a sequence of courses – that could show as “French 4 OR (French 1 + 2 + 3)” if they allow completing the sequence to count).
Alternate tracks example: Some majors like UC Davis Psychology allow two tracks: a Biology emphasis or a Quantitative emphasis. If ASSIST were to reflect that, they might implement it as Section A = Bio track courses, Section B = Quantitative track courses, under a group “Complete one of the following tracks.” That is similar to the CS Group 1 example but on a larger scale (covering multiple courses per track). So far, our discussion hasn’t seen an explicit example in the provided data, but it’s conceptually possible and the system can handle it (through choose_one_section with multiple courses in each section).
Honors across CCCs: All CCCs with honors programs list honors courses similarly. So Pasadena’s honors Psych 001H or Santa Monica’s Engl 2H will just be alternatives for Psych 001 or Engl 2. No differences except the course code.
To give concrete cross-institution examples in brief:
Foothill College → UC Irvine, Psychology (B.A.): Likely an agreement where: Group 1: General Psych (Foothill PSYC 1 = UCI Psych 7A), Group 2: Statistics (Foothill MATH 10 or PSYC 7 = UCI Psych 10A) – note this OR (two department options for stats), Group 3: Biological Psychology or alternative (Foothill might not have an exact Neurobiology course, so maybe “No articulation” or an option to take a biology class instead). Group 4: maybe an introductory sociology or anthropology (if UCI requires a social science breadth). The structure would be a mix of all-required and one small OR choice. If Foothill lacks a course, “No articulation” will appear. If comparing to Pasadena City → UC Davis, Psychology: perhaps very similar, though PCC being semester might have combined courses (e.g. a combined statistics+methods course that covers two UCD requirements, which might then be articulated differently).
Santa Monica College → UC Berkeley, English: Possibly UCB doesn’t list much. But if they do: likely require two English lit survey courses. SMC has several (English ENG literature courses), maybe broken into sections: Section A: select one from British Lit options, Section B: select one from American Lit options, for example. Meanwhile Santa Monica → UCSB, English: UCSB might articulate many specific courses (like one course for Shakespeare, one for lit theory if offered at SMC, etc.). So UCSB’s agreement might have more groups (each corresponding to one requirement like “Shakespeare – No equivalent at SMC” or “Literary Theory – take SMC English 2 (which is critical analysis) as equivalent to our intro theory course”). The variation lies in what each campus expects and what the CCC offers, not in how ASSIST presents logic. The presentation adapts: if UCSB says “choose 2 out of 3 categories of literature”, ASSIST will show that selection.
In all, the ASSIST model scales across CCC→UC pairs. Every CCC’s courses differ, but the articulation structure (group logic) doesn’t fundamentally change. What changes is just the content plugged into that structure:
Some agreements have more “No course articulated” entries (often smaller or more specialized CCCs might not offer all courses).
Some have longer lists of elective options (especially larger CCCs that offer many courses in a field, leading to a longer list to choose from for an area).
Some have more alternate sections (especially if the UC allows multiple tracks or the CCC has multiple ways to cover a requirement).
Despite these differences, a student or system parsing the agreements can rely on the consistent use of group numbers, section letters, and logic phrases to interpret any of them.
6. Standards, Data Models & Update Policy
Data Models / Exportable Formats: The modern ASSIST platform is backed by a structured database and can output data in JSON/XML formats, although public access is limited. Internally, ASSIST defines schemas for agreements – for example, a Template Agreement consists of groups, group items, and so on. (We accessed a JSON snippet for the De Anza–UCSD CS agreement, which clearly shows fields like group_logic_type, section_courses, logic_structure, etc., indicating a well-defined model.) Officially, ASSIST has been working on providing data extracts and APIs. According to ASSIST documentation, a Data Portal for self-service was launched in late 2023 for institutions, and work on an API/web services is underway​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. There is a plan for public data sharing via API, though it has been delayed due to performance and security concerns (partly because of heavy unauthorized scraping activity)​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. The timeline mentioned suggests existing partners (CSU, UC, CCC system offices) might get API access in the 2025-2026 year, with wider public access potentially in 2026-2027​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. This indicates that a formal data model (likely JSON-based as we suspect) exists to describe articulation. Indeed, the ASSIST API documentation references objects like “TemplateGroup”, “TemplateCourseCell,” etc. that encapsulate the articulation logic (groups, sections, course pairs, etc.). While not publicly distributed yet, ASSIST is moving towards official JSON extract files and APIs as part of its strategic plan​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. For now, articulation data is mainly accessed through the web interface or via PDF downloads for legacy years. Responsibility for Writing/Approving Articulation Rules: Articulation agreements are the result of collaboration between community college articulation officers and university articulation officers/faculty. Typically:
The receiving institution (university) has the final say on what courses it will accept for its requirements. Each UC campus usually has an Articulation Officer in the Registrar or Undergraduate Admissions office who coordinates with academic departments. For each CCC course proposed for articulation, departmental faculty at the UC may review syllabi to decide if it’s equivalent.
The community college articulation officer initiates or facilitates requests and provides course information. CCC Articulation Officers also ensure the courses are CSU/UC transferable first (through UC Transfer Course Agreement and CSU transfer lists) before seeking specific articulation.
ASSIST coordination: Historically, UCOP (University of California Office of the President) and the CSU Chancellor’s Office manage system-wide transfer course approvals (like UC TCA – the list of CCC courses transferable for UC credit). But major articulation agreements are maintained campus-by-campus. For UC-to-CCC agreements, each UC campus is responsible for updating and publishing its agreements with each CCC​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. This is echoed in CIAC guidelines: “lower division major preparation agreements… are initiated, maintained, and published on ASSIST by each individual CSU campus” and similarly for UC campuses​

There is also a group of ASSIST “data managers” – essentially the designated officials at each institution who have access to enter data into the ASSIST database. The Statement on ASSIST Data Requests notes there are ~400 data managers across 160 institutions (CCC, CSU, UC, AICCU) working with ASSIST​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. These are the people (articulation officers and their staff) who input the agreement info into ASSIST’s templates.
In summary, articulation rules are written through inter-institutional agreements: CCC and university articulation personnel agree on them, and then they are encoded into ASSIST by the university’s articulation officer or ASSIST data manager. CIAC (the council of articulation officers) provides a forum for developing best practices but doesn’t approve specific course articulations – that’s handled by the institutions. UCOP’s role is more on the policy and transferability side, ensuring courses are eligible for articulation (via the UC TCA process each year for CCC courses) and sometimes brokering UC-wide initiatives (like UC Transfer Pathways). But the content of each articulation agreement is overseen by the individual UC campus for UC-to-CCC articulations​
csusb.edu
. Maintaining & Updating Data:
Update Frequency: Articulation agreements are typically updated on an annual cycle. The academic year of ASSIST agreements runs fall through summer (mirroring catalog years). Usually, during winter/spring, articulation officers negotiate and finalize any changes for the upcoming year (especially if new CCC courses were introduced or UC requirements changed). The ASSIST platform allows publishing these updates when ready. According to ASSIST’s FAQ, the new academic year agreements often begin to appear in spring or summer before that year starts​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. Many campuses aim to have updates up by around July or August for the new fall term, though it can vary.
The FAQ says: “The availability of new articulation agreements begins the summer before the academic year and varies by institution. Each university is responsible for updating and publishing agreements”​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. Some factors (like curriculum updates, staffing) can cause delays. It also notes that some campuses may publish simpler agreements first (departmental ones) and take longer for complex major agreements​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. For example, a campus might post GE and department-to-department articulation early, but the specific major articulation might come a bit later if still under review.
Once an agreement for a given year is published on ASSIST, any changes made by articulation officers are reflected immediately after they are “published” in the system. ASSIST mentions that changes appear immediately after publication, subject to the academic year being available on the site.
Are mid-year updates possible? Yes, if necessary, but articulation agreements usually correspond to catalog years. If a course is added mid-year, they might add an articulation effective Spring term. ASSIST can handle effective term annotations, but articulation officers might instead queue it for the next year unless it’s urgent. The FAQ implies that display of changes depends on publication rules for mid-year adjustments. In practice, if a new course was approved to articulate starting Spring 2025, they could publish an updated 2024-2025 agreement with that noted.
Review and Versioning: Each agreement is tied to a specific academic year (e.g., 2024–2025). Users can select previous years on ASSIST to see how agreements may have changed. ASSIST does not retroactively update old years; it creates new entries each year (legacy ASSIST provided PDFs per year; new ASSIST provides HTML per year). If an agreement isn’t ready, ASSIST might still be showing the last available year with a note. Versioning is essentially by year. Within a year, if something changes, the articulation officer might add a note like “(Effective Spring 2025, course X added)” or update the listing with an annotation. But wholesale changes usually wait for the next year. There is a record internally of when data was last modified, but end-users mainly see the static snapshot for that year.
Who maintains the data? Practically, the ASSIST Central Services team maintains the infrastructure and provides support, but the content is maintained by the articulation community (the data managers at each institution)​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. The Statement on Data Requests emphasizes ASSIST’s role as the central provider of current articulation data for users and downstream systems​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
, which suggests they take data accuracy seriously. The community college and university articulation officers continuously communicate to update agreements, especially if a CCC course changes (title, units, content) or a university requirement changes. There’s an Articulation Calendar (mentioned in CIAC handbook) that outlines when to submit courses for UC review, when CSU GE reviews happen, etc., so articulation updates align with those cycles.
Legal/Ethical Sourcing of ASSIST Data for TransferAI: TransferAI would ideally like to ingest ASSIST data into its system to model articulation. However, directly scraping or using ASSIST data comes with considerations:
Legal Terms: ASSIST is a publicly funded system, but it likely has usage terms that discourage bulk scraping. The data itself (course articulation rules) might not be copyrighted per se (they are facts or agreements), but the compilation and the platform are controlled. The Statement on Data Requests explicitly noted “excessive and unauthorized data scraping” caused performance issues and forced them to focus on secure API development​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. This implies that scraping ASSIST without permission was happening and is frowned upon. They have paused fulfilling data requests to focus on the API, and they anticipate requiring license agreements for third-party data use once the API is ready​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. That suggests that to legally use the articulation data in another system, one may need to sign a license or agreement with ASSIST (likely through UCOP).
Ethical Considerations: Ethically, since ASSIST is the official source, any data used should be up-to-date and accurate. If TransferAI scrapes data and stores it, it assumes responsibility to keep it updated whenever ASSIST updates. There’s also the ethical concern of representing the data correctly – any misinterpretation could mislead students. So using ASSIST data requires careful attention to version and context. Also, given ASSIST’s role, some in the articulation community might have concerns about an external tool duplicating data and possibly presenting it without the nuances or disclaimers (ASSIST includes disclaimers about agreements being subject to change, etc.).
Current stance: As of 2025, there is no open public API. ASSIST’s program indicates they will consider third-party access in 2026-2027 with proper licensing​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. So TransferAI would be well-advised to coordinate with ASSIST/UCOP for data access. Possibly by partnering with a CCC or UC (existing partner), they might get earlier access once APIs are in testing. The non-institution-dependent data requests (like a private company asking for data) are on hold until at least the 2025-2026 year, according to that statement​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
 (“will revisit in 2025-2026 academic year…”).
Alternatives: In the meantime, some data can be gleaned from ASSIST’s public interface or by manually compiling from PDFs, but doing so at scale without permission might violate terms-of-use or at least upset the ASSIST team (especially if it burdens the site). Since the data is factual (what articulates with what), one could argue it’s public information, but because it’s presented in a curated way, it’s best to engage with ASSIST officially. TransferAI could also supplement with publicly available Transfer Admission Planner info or university department websites for requirements, but those won’t have the detailed articulation that ASSIST has.
In short, TransferAI can model the structure (groups, logic, etc.) in its system, but for actual data, it should ideally obtain it through authorized channels. Legally, using ASSIST data likely requires permission or waiting for the planned public API with a license. Ethically, one would not want to use outdated or partial data, so syncing with ASSIST’s updates is crucial.
7. Counselor and Student Interpretation
The ASSIST system is designed to be used by both community college counselors and students, and increasingly by developers of advising tools. However, interpreting its output correctly is vital. Here’s how it’s intended and some common pitfalls/ambiguities in interpretation:
For Community College Counselors: Counselors are trained in articulation and typically use ASSIST as a primary reference when advising students. The structured format with groups and sections helps counselors systematically check off requirements. Counselors understand terms like “No course articulated” to mean the student must plan to take that course after transfer​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. They also know that when ASSIST says “select 2 courses,” it’s the minimum – taking more is fine but not necessary. Counselors often have the context of the student’s goals (e.g., which major at which campus) and can navigate multiple ASSIST agreements if the student is considering various targets. They also have access to ASSIST’s admin side and updates, and often have additional guidance from CIAC or local agreements. In practice, a counselor will print or pull up the ASSIST agreement for the student’s intended major and walk through each group, translating it into lay terms: e.g., “You need to take these four courses. For this requirement, you have a choice: either take Course X or the sequence Y and Z – which do you prefer?” Essentially, counselors act as the human interpreters of ASSIST’s sometimes technical display, ensuring the student understands their options and requirements. Because of their background, counselors are adept at catching nuances (like “No course articulated – you’ll do that at the UC” or “This course sequence must be completed fully”).
For Transfer Students: ASSIST is supposed to be student-facing and user-friendly, but not all students find it intuitive, especially with complex logic. The modernization added helpful text and color cues, but students may still be puzzled by things like:
What does it mean when multiple courses are indented under one? (Students might not immediately get that it means “take both”; hence the addition of explicit “AND” labels in green, etc.)
The presence of A/B sections might confuse students if they don’t read the instruction. A student might ask, “Do I need to do both Section A and B?” if they miss the “or” wording. The site literally says “Complete A or B,” but some students overlook the small details. Counselors or orientation materials have to emphasize how to read that.
Students might not know that they need to scroll or expand sections. Some ASSIST pages require clicking to expand coursework or scroll horizontally to see all columns (units, etc.). The new ASSIST is one long page per agreement, so scrolling is needed. A student could misinterpret if they don’t scroll fully or if they see a partial list and think that’s all.
The question mark help icon on ASSIST (introduced to explain major vs department vs GE agreements)​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
 is intended to assist students in choosing the right view. Yet, it’s possible a student might accidentally look at a “department” articulation instead of “major” if a major agreement isn’t available, and not realize the difference. The site tries to clarify that (grays out unavailable options, etc.), but confusion can still occur.
Despite these, many savvy students use ASSIST effectively. They often cross-reference it with their counselors and with university admissions websites. Universities usually instruct students: “Use ASSIST to find our articulation agreements.” So students know it’s the go-to source.
For Developers (e.g., TransferAI): ASSIST wasn’t originally designed with external developers in mind (hence the lack of an API until now). But developers can interpret its data to build tools. The structure is logical enough to be parsed and re-presented in more interactive ways (like a planning app). One challenge is that ASSIST doesn’t explicitly state some things that a developer might need to clarify:
For example, prerequisites at the CCC: ASSIST tells you what courses to take, but it doesn’t list the prerequisites for those CCC courses. A student might see on ASSIST that they need to take CIS 26B for UCSD’s CSE 30, and not realize that CIS 22B is a prereq for CIS 26B at De Anza (just as a hypothetical). The counselor would normally catch that by looking at the CCC’s catalog. If TransferAI is guiding students, it should incorporate CCC prerequisite knowledge to warn “to take CIS 26B, you must first take CIS 22A/22B” or whatever. Otherwise, a student might plan wrong. This is an ambiguity because ASSIST’s scope is articulation, not course scheduling – it assumes you’ll handle prerequisites via your college counseling.
Double counting and overlap: ASSIST lists each requirement separately, but doesn’t explicitly tell you if one course can fulfill two requirements simultaneously. In general, for major prep, one course won’t count for two different major requirements (except possibly a cross-listed scenario which is essentially the same course). But between GE and major, sometimes one course can satisfy both a GE requirement and a major requirement. ASSIST doesn’t coordinate between a GE agreement and a major agreement – that’s up to the student or counselor to realize. For instance, IGETC Area 5 might require a science course, and the major also required a science course – a single CCC course (like BIOL 10) might satisfy both, but ASSIST won’t highlight that on the major page. It just shows BIOL 10 under the major’s list and also shows it on the GE list. The student or an advising tool must notice the overlap opportunity. This can be confusing for students (“Do I have to take it twice? No, it counts for both.”).
Outdated info: If a student doesn’t pay attention to year, they might use an old agreement. ASSIST always defaults to the latest year available, but some students accidentally look at the wrong year or don’t realize they should use the year they plan to transfer (usually the current or upcoming year). Counselors ensure they use the correct year, but a self-serve student might not.
Interpretation of “No course articulated”: A student might incorrectly think “Oh, it says no course articulated for CSE 15L – maybe I don’t have to take it.” In reality, it means “you can’t take it here; you’ll take it at UCSD.” A tool like TransferAI should flag that and maybe even explain: “This course has no equivalent at your college – you will need to take it after transfer.”
Impacted majors or GPA requirements not on ASSIST: Students might not realize completion of courses is not the only factor; GPA matters but ASSIST doesn’t mention needed GPAs (except in any general notes). Counselors fill in: “All courses must be C or better” (which is generally assumed) or “This major is very competitive; aim for higher grades.” A sophisticated advising tool might incorporate admission rates or GPA recommendations alongside the articulation info. That goes beyond ASSIST but is crucial for interpretation.
Ambiguities or Inconsistencies in ASSIST itself: Generally, the new format reduced ambiguities in reading the logic. But a few things can still be tricky:
When a UC course is labeled but no CCC course underneath (just “No Course Articulated”): As mentioned, students can misread that. The FAQ explicitly addresses it​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
 to clarify meaning.
Courses appearing twice (like cross-listed issues): If a course shows up in two places, a student might wonder if they need to take it twice. Usually it’s because it’s filling two requirements (one of which might ultimately be waived because the course double-counts). This is rare in the articulation list itself, but an example: American History could satisfy a major requirement for History major and also the American Institutions requirement for CSU. A student sees it in the major list and also in the CSU AI GE list. They might not realize one course can do both. The ASSIST Resource Center tutorial likely explains that general education and major prep are separate agreements and a course can fulfill a slot in each. TransferAI could help by automatically recognizing overlaps and informing the student.
Missing rows or years: If an agreement isn’t updated (like some CSU/UC in past years had gaps), students might be confused by an absence of information. The new site grays out unavailable agreements and advises not to rely on department articulation for major info​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
, but that situation itself is confusing. For instance, if a student in 2025 sees that UCB 2024-25 major agreement for Film is not available, they might not know what courses to take. Counselors might then use the 2016-17 PDF or other hints. Inconsistency in availability is an issue outside the student’s control.
How TransferAI should handle uncertainties:
Explicit Explanations: Whenever the raw articulation data might confuse, provide a plain-language explanation. For example, next to a “No course articulated” entry, put a note like “(To be taken at the university)” – even though ASSIST doesn’t say it, this helps the user​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. For an “OR” group, the tool could say “choose one of the following options (either all courses in Section A or all in Section B)”.
Prerequisite awareness: Integrate each CCC’s course prerequisite information (from college catalogs) so that if a student adds a course from the plan, the tool can warn “Requires prerequisite X, which is also in your plan/not in your plan.” This ensures they don’t plan to take a course without the proper sequence. ASSIST assumes users will figure that out via counseling or experience, but an AI tool can make it explicit.
Double-counting logic: The tool can automatically recognize if a course in the major prep list also satisfies a GE requirement or is in another list (since it will have the data for both). It can then inform the student: “Good news, Course ABC will also satisfy a general education requirement!” or advise them on efficient course selection. Essentially, integrate major and GE articulation for a holistic plan – something ASSIST itself presents separately.
Currency of data: Make sure to label the academic year of the agreement being shown, and whenever a new year is out, update promptly. If TransferAI is using 2024-2025 data and the user’s transfer target is Fall 2025, that’s fine. But if 2025-2026 gets published and the student is now planning for that, the tool should update. Including a “last updated on…” or “Using ASSIST data for year X” note would maintain transparency.
Impacted majors and GPA: Where possible, include context from universities. For instance, if a major is known to be selective, mention “This major is selective; completing these courses does not guarantee admission. Maintain a strong GPA (e.g. 3.5+) for best chances.” Such info might come from UC campus websites or ASSIST’s own notes (like the UCSD CS example had text about impaction). TransferAI should surface those general advice notes that appear at the top of ASSIST agreements (our JSON had a “major_overview” document with lots of advice text). So the tool should not ignore that freeform text – it often contains valuable counseling information.
Edge cases & unclear articulations: If something is truly confusing in ASSIST, TransferAI could flag it for human review. For example, if a course appears to articulate differently than expected or if an agreement is missing. Perhaps provide a recommendation like “consult a counselor for this requirement” if the tool cannot confidently deduce what to do. Better to admit uncertainty than mislead.
Trustworthiness and clarity: The tool should mirror ASSIST’s authoritative data but in a more user-friendly narrative. For example, rather than the student seeing: “Group 3: Select 2 courses from: BIOL 6A+6B+6C OR BIOL 6AH+6B+6CH; CHEM 1A or 1AH; CHEM 1B or 1BH; PHYS 4A; PHYS 4B” (which is a lot), the tool could say: “Science Requirement: Choose two science courses from the following options – for example, you could take General Chemistry I and II, or Physics (mechanics and electricity). At De Anza, popular choices are CHEM 1A & 1B or PHYS 4A & 4B. If you prefer Biology, you would need to complete the entire Biology 6A/6B/6C sequence to count as one of the two courses (which would actually cover both of your two required courses and then some).” This kind of explanation is what a counselor might verbally give, and an AI could generate, using ASSIST data as a base. Providing this clear reasoning helps students make informed choices rather than just seeing raw lists.
In essence, TransferAI should act as a smart layer on top of ASSIST data, elucidating anything that might be confusing and combining information from multiple sources (ASSIST, college catalogs, admission info) to give a coherent advising picture. The goal is to preserve accuracy (hence using ASSIST as the foundation) while enhancing clarity and personalization.
8. Final Deliverables for TransferAI
In conclusion, to effectively model ASSIST’s articulation system within TransferAI, we should provide:
Definitions of Structural Terms:
Group: A numbered collection of one or more requirements in an articulation agreement, usually corresponding to a major requirement category or GE area. All groups together comprise the full set of articulated requirements for that agreement. Groups often have an instruction indicating how to satisfy them (e.g. “Complete the following course,” “Select 2 courses from the list,” “Complete Group 1 or Group 2”).
Section: A lettered subdivision of a group, used when there are alternate sets of requirements or sub-requirements within a group. Sections (A, B, C, etc.) typically represent distinct options or tracks. If a group says “Complete Section A or B,” each section is an alternative route to fulfill that group. If a group is all-required but divided into sections, the sections are just for clarity (and both must be completed).
Requirement Area: (Primarily in GE articulation) A category of requirements (like IGETC Area 1A, CSU Area C2). It defines a thematic area in which a certain number of courses must be taken. In ASSIST, requirement areas appear as group titles or section headers in GE agreements, often with specific rules (e.g. “Complete 3 courses: one from Area 4A, one from 4B, one from 4C” in CSU GE). In major articulation, one could use “requirement area” loosely to mean a set of courses like “Math Requirements” – on ASSIST this might just be an unlabeled group but conceptually it’s an area of requirements.
Group Logic Types:
choose_one_section – Only one of the multiple sections in this group must be completed. (Displayed as “Complete A or B or C…” on ASSIST.) This implements an OR at the section level.
all_required – All listed sections/courses in the group are required. (No alternative choice given in group instruction.) Essentially an AND across everything in that group.
select_n_courses – The student must select a specified number (N) of courses from a list in that group. (Displayed as “Select N courses from the following.”) This is a combinatorial requirement: any N of the options will do.
(If there are any other minor logic indicators, e.g. sometimes “Complete 1 course from each section A and B” – that is effectively two select_1 in separate sections rather than a single logic type.)
In ASSIST’s data, these cover all scenarios. For TransferAI’s JSON modeling, we can mirror these: e.g., a Group object could have a field logicType with values “ALL_REQUIRED”, “CHOOSE_ONE_SECTION”, “SELECT_N_COURSES”, and if SELECT_N_COURSES, also an nCourses value.
Real Examples for Each Logic Type:
Choose One Section: UCSD CSE Intro Requirement – Group 1 in the De Anza→UCSD CS agreement: “Complete A or B.” Section A required two courses (CSE 8A & 8B via equivalent CCC courses); Section B required one course (CSE 11 via CCC equivalents). Only one section needed. Students choose either Section A (the two-course route) or Section B (the one-course route). This is a clear choose-one-section example.
All Required: UCSD CSE Core Group – Group 2 in the same agreement listed five specific CSE courses and four math courses, all of which the student must complete (no alternatives given). The instruction was “N/A” (meaning no special choice) and ASSIST marked it as all_required in data. Every course in Group 2 (CSE 12, 15L, 20, 21, 30, and Math 18, 20A, 20B, 20C) must be completed if available. Where De Anza had no equivalent (CSE 15L, 21), it showed “No course articulated” (meaning those still have to be completed, just not at De Anza). So that group is a straightforward list of requirements.
Select N Courses: UCSD Science Electives for CS – Group 3 in De Anza→UCSD CS: “Select 2 courses from the following.” The agreement then lists BILD 1, BILD 2, BILD 3, CHEM 6A, CHEM 6B, PHYS 2A, PHYS 2B, PHYS 4A, PHYS 4B with their equivalents. The student can take any two of those UCSD courses (and therefore their two CCC equivalents). For example, picking CHEM 6A and CHEM 6B (which correspond to CHEM 1A and 1B at De Anza) would satisfy this. This is a select 2 out of 9 scenario – the articulation lists all 9 possibilities. (Note: as discussed, some of those possibilities are bundled; e.g., BILD 1 is actually achieved by a bundle of CCC courses, but from the perspective of choosing “two courses,” BILD 1 counts as one choice once that bundle is done.) Another simpler example: CSU GE Area C might say “Select 3 courses from Area C (Arts & Humanities).” If ASSIST were showing that, it would have Area C split into C1 (Arts) and C2 (Humanities), often requiring at least 1 from each, but some patterns say 3 total with at least one in each. That could be modeled as select 3 with a constraint. Typically, though, ASSIST would implement the sub-requirement by sections (choose one from C1, one from C2, and an additional from either). That’s more complex logic but effectively a combination of select 1 in one section, select 1 in second section, and select 1 more overall – which is handled by splitting into multiple groups or sections.
Visual Samples / Screenshots Description: (Since we cannot embed actual ASSIST screenshots here, we describe them.) For instance, a screenshot of the Communication B.A. articulation (Allan Hancock College → UCSB) from the modernization flyer shows:
A header “PRE-MAJOR REQUIREMENTS” in purple,
Then “1 – Complete 1 course from the following” in a white banner​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. Under that, it lists two courses: COMM 87 (Statistical Analysis for Comm) and MATH 123 (Elementary Statistics), each with their units​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. They are separated by an OR. One of them has “5.0” units, the other “4.0”, showing unit values, and there was also an entry for PSTAT 5A (Statistics for Life Sciences) and an entry “No course articulated, but acceptable for substitution” in the legacy example – but the modern display likely simply wouldn’t list a “No course” as an option unless it’s part of an or (the flyer indicates legacy vs next-gen vs mod differences). The point is the screenshot demonstrates an example of select 1 from multiple (COMM 87 or PSTAT 5A or PSY 5 or No Course or MATH 123) across versions​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. The modern version clearly only lists actual options (the “No course articulated” in legacy was a footnote about something acceptable for substitution, which likely got resolved in modern display by either excluding it or clarifying it differently).
Another screenshot (from the same flyer page) for the “MOD” design shows a purple “1” box and then the text “Complete 1 course from the following” with courses listed in a cleaner format​
assist-resource-center.azurewebsites.net
. This matches how we’d display a select 1 list.
If we had a screenshot of the De Anza→UCSD CS page: one would see Group 1 labeled and a statement like “Group 1 (Programming): Complete Section A or B.” Then Section A header with maybe a brief label “Introductory Programming Sequence” and listing UCSD CSE 8A and CSE 8B each with an indentation showing De Anza options beneath (CIS 22A or 36A or 40 for 8A; CIS 36B for 8B). Section B header “Accelerated Programming” with UCSD CSE 11 and its CCC options (CIS 35A or CIS 36A+36B). The site uses indentation and arrows to show CIS 36A and 36B are linked for the second option for CSE 11. Section B as a whole is visually separate from section A (maybe a line or background difference). Then Group 2 might be a big list (could be labeled “Group 2: Major Requirements – All of the following” or just no instruction if N/A). That list would show each UCSD course (CSE12, 15L, etc.) with either a CCC equivalent or “No course articulated.” On screen, “No course articulated” might be italic gray text under CSE 15L and CSE 21 where an equivalent would normally appear. Group 3 would show “Group 3: Select 2 courses from the following” and then a grid or list of each UCSD course (BILD1, BILD2, etc.) possibly with sub-bullets for the CCC courses. For example, BILD1 line might have a sub-list of two bullet options (the regular bio series vs honors bio series). CHEM6A line would have two bullet options (CHEM 1A or 1AH). PHYS2A line might have one bullet (PHYS 4A). Each of those nine UCSD courses is an item with its CCC mapping. A student would presumably pick any two lines and ensure they complete those at CCC. If I were to illustrate one visually: BILD 1 has a bracket connecting BIOL 6A, 6B, 6C with an “AND” label to show all three needed, and similarly for the honors set. CHEM 6A has an OR between CHEM 1A and 1AH. So the visual elements differ by requirement.
Since we cannot embed the actual images, the above descriptions serve as “screenshots in words.”

This is illustrative, but the idea is to nest the data and include fields for combinations and honors. TransferAI’s model should capture:
Group instructions and types.
Section breakdown (if applicable).
Course articulations, including multiple CCC options for a single UC course. Possibly mark if an option is a combination (AND) of courses vs single (this can be done by listing multiple course codes in one option as I did with “courseCombination”).
A flag for “no course articulated” (which could simply be an empty options list or a boolean flag on that course).
The model should also have space for additional notes (for instance, if a certain course combination is only valid if both taken in a certain order or if a partial sequence gives partial credit – though usually not).
Also incorporate any footnotes or general advice from the agreement as top-level text.
By structuring it this way, TransferAI can programmatically decide what courses a student needs and present choices where appropriate.
Explaining Articulation Outcomes to Users (AI Output Format): When an AI assistant or the app communicates this info to a student, it should transform the raw data into friendly guidance. For example:
Instead of “Group 1: Complete A or B,” say: “You have two options to fulfill the introductory programming requirement: Option A – take CIS 22A and CIS 36B (this covers UCSD’s CSE 8A & 8B sequence), or Option B – take CIS 35A (which covers the accelerated course CSE 11). You only need to do one of these options.” This explicitly names the CCC courses and clarifies one path vs the other.
For all-required groups, just list them as required courses: “You will need to complete the following courses (or their equivalents): CIS 22C (Data Structures), CIS 26B (Computer Organization), MATH 2B, 2C, etc. Note: there are no De Anza equivalents for UCSD’s CSE 15L and CSE 21, so you will take those after transfer.” This way the student isn’t left wondering about the “No articulation” entries.
For select-N groups, guide the choice: “Additionally, UCSD asks you to take any two science courses from this list: Biology, Chemistry, or Physics. At De Anza, common choices are CHEM 1A & 1B (General Chem I and II) since those each count as one course. If you’re interested in Biology, you’d have to take the entire BIOL 6A/B/C sequence at De Anza to cover the biology options – completing that sequence would actually give you credit for all three UCSD biology courses BILD 1, 2, 3, which more than meets the ‘two courses’ requirement. Choose the two that align best with your interests or other requirements (for instance, CHEM 1A/B also satisfy physical science GE).” This kind of advice combines articulation info with strategic insight – something an AI can provide if programmed with rules or trained on counseling knowledge.
Honors note: If an honors course is listed, clarify that either the honors or the regular version will suffice. For example, “De Anza offers honors versions (CHEM 1AH, 1BH). You can take either the honors or non-honors – both will count the same in articulation. Only do honors if you are in the honors program or prefer the challenge.”
Emphasize any hidden prerequisites: “CIS 26B (Advanced C Programming) at De Anza has prerequisites (CIS 22B). Make sure you’ve taken the required prior courses at De Anza before enrolling.” (This info comes from De Anza catalog rather than ASSIST.)
Provide timeline advice: “We recommend completing as many of these courses before transfer as possible (especially the math and programming) to be a competitive applicant. The UCSD CS department notes that not completing them can delay graduation.” This is from the general advice text which our JSON had.
In short, the AI output should be conversational and advisory, using the ASSIST data as a backbone. It should clearly indicate requirements, options, and planning tips. This way, TransferAI can emulate the guidance a student would get in an appointment with a counselor, backed by the exact articulation agreements the counselor would reference (ASSIST).
By implementing the above, TransferAI will effectively replicate the logic of ASSIST and enhance it with user-friendly explanations. The combination of structured data and natural language guidance will make the articulation agreements interpretable and actionable for students, which is exactly our goal. Sources:
