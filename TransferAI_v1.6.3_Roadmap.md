🐛 Issues Found
[x] Test 2 & 3:
❌ These tests are marked as QueryType.HONORS_REQUIREMENT but are actually course lookup queries
💡 Fix query type detection to properly identify these as COURSE_LOOKUP
[x] Test 10:
❌ Similar query type detection issue (marked as HONORS_REQUIREMENT)
💡 Fix query service to properly distinguish between honor requirements and course lookups
[x] Test 12:
❌ Marked as QueryType.COURSE_LOOKUP but should be COURSE_VALIDATION
💡 Improve query detection for validation-style questions
[x] Test 21:
❌ Identified as HONORS_REQUIREMENT but should be COURSE_LOOKUP for multiple courses
💡 Query type detection needs refinement for queries with multiple UC courses
[x] Test 23 & 26:
❌ Contains orphaned "No articulation" messages for PHYS 4A and PHYS 4B
💡 Clean up group presentation for courses with no articulation
⚠ Suggested Improvements
[x] Test 5 & 6:
💡 Results could be more explicit about whether mixing courses across sections is allowed
💡 Add clearer guidance about the Group 1 section requirements
[x] Test 8 & 9:
💡 Consider adding more explicit section headers for clarity
💡 Formatting could be improved to make it easier to scan group requirements
[x] Test 14:
💡 Response is clear but could include information about alternatives at UCSD
💡 Consider adding recommendations for courses that could be taken at UCSD instead
[x] Test 15:
💡 Could include more detailed guidance on the complete pathway for CSE 30
💡 Add context about CIS 26B/26BH being the only remaining course needed
[x] Test 27:
💡 Should clarify that students need to select exactly 2 courses from Group 3
💡 Could explicitly note that CHEM 6A and PHYS 2A satisfy Group 3 requirements
📎 General Recommendations
Improve consistency in query type detection, especially for "which courses satisfy X" type questions
Fix the incorrect identification of course lookup queries as honors requirement queries
Ensure consistent messaging for courses with no articulation across all handlers
Consider adding more tests for edge cases like partial matches and complex articulation logic
Review handlers to ensure they're using the correct metadata fields for articulation validation
Make sure group queries with orphaned "No articulation" messages are handled consistently
Add more explicit tests for the COURSE_COMPARISON query type to ensure robust comparison handling
Consider improving the formatting of responses for better readability, especially for group requirements
❓Follow-up
To finalize this audit:
> The test suite already covers:
> - Reverse lookups (Test 31, 35: What does CIS 36A satisfy)
> - Honors and non-honors matching (Tests 32, 33: Are honors courses required)
> - Multi-section group articulation (Tests 8, 9, 23, 26: Group requirement tests)
> - Courses with no articulation (Tests 14, 16: CSE 21, CSE 15L)
>
> Missing or needs enhancement:
> - "Same as" equivalencies could be more explicit
> - Add explicit tests for group completion with mixed honors/non-honors courses
> - Include tests for more complex articulation structures
> - Add tests for queries about transfer requirements not covered by articulation data
The test suite is comprehensive but would benefit from addressing the query type detection issues and improving consistency in response formatting.
