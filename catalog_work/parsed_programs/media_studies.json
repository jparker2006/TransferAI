  "program_description": "Media is a versatile discipline consisting of two areas of study: media studies and media production. Our media studies area focuses on the analysis of the mass media. Media Studies courses use an analytical and historical approach, and students develop skills to assess the role and impact of mass media on society. Students examine the history, values, and structure of media in the US and internationally. Media literacy skills are another fundamental component of Media Studies Courses. Upon successful completion of our Media Studies courses, each student should leave as a media literate individual — a more aware, critical audience member with a well-developed sense of mass media’s role in society. There is a wide range of employment possibilities for students trained in Media Studies, including positions in public relations, business, sales, public and personnel relations, and advertising. Our Media Production courses provide hands-on training in the areas of Television, Radio and Internet Broadcasting, including broadcast news, sports, promotional videos, podcasting, short form and emerging media (360/virtual and augmented reality). Students completing the Broadcasting degrees and/or certificates are prepared for both employment opportunities in the broadcasting industry and transfer into four-year degree programs. The Promo Pathways program provides intensive training and internships for students pursuing promo advertising careers opportunities in the broadcasting industry and transfer into four-year degree programs.",
