  "program_description": "Film consists of two areas of concentration: Film Studies and Film Production. Film Studies introduces students to the history and development of cinema/film as an art, an object of philosophical study, and a cultural and social phenomenon. Students examine the theoretical approaches and trends in filmmaking including the contemporary evolution from film to digital media. Film Production provides practical as well as theoretical training in screenwriting, directing, creative producing, cinematography, sound recording, production design, and below-the-line crafts (gaffers, grips, operators, assistants). Students learn all aspects of film production from an academic discipline to hands-on experience that prepares them to earn an Associate degree and/or certificate of achievement in film production; for upper division study at a four-year college or advanced film school; and/or to apply for jobs and internships in the motion picture and television industries.",

Students will learn about the basic cinematic techniques and structures, including mise-en-scene and montage, use of cinematic time and space, the image, soundtrack, and the script. Consideration will also be given to analyzing the fundamentals of film production, directing, acting, and editing; how the elements of the production process are analyzed separately, then brought together to show how they create the emotional and intellectual impact of the film experience. Film examples will be screened in class. This course is intended as a beginning course to introduce students to cinema.",
