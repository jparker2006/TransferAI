Issues examined include the development of gender identity, theoretical and practical implications of power and oppression, cultural and socializing agents, and application of theory to classroom environments and curriculum, including strategies to empower teachers to develop pedagogical skills to support all children. Students will self-examine and reflect on personal experiences related to gender identity and expression, gender stereotypes and bias, cultural implications, and media and societal impacts. Students will recognize and contrast perspectives through an intersectional lens that promotes understanding, knowledge, and skills for supporting all children. Topics and strategies will be explored emphasizing culturally and linguistically focused anti-bias approaches.",
