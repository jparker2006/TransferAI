  "program_description": "Art History is the study of art created in the past by individuals from various cultures and parts of the world. It is the study of the historical development of art as social and intellectual phenomenon, the analysis of works of art and art conservation. Students study specific periods, cultures, styles and themes. The art historian seeks to interpret and understand works of art of many types, ranging from the monumental to small scale, by learning about artists’ lives and their societies. Students are prepared for a wide range of professional careers — in museums, galleries, auction houses or publishing, including antique dealer, art appraiser, art dealer, art restorer and museum curator.",
