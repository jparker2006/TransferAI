Political science has four well-defined subfields: political theory, international relations, comparative politics, and American politics. Courses focus on topics and pressing problems, among them war, law, local, state, and national politics, voting, mass media, public opinion, poverty, human rights, race, gender, ideology, class, international organizations, revolutions, and failed states in all parts of the world. Students in these courses learn to critically analyze not only the behavior of political actors, but also their respective political institutions and political systems. The main objectives are to enable students to use strong analytical skills and critical thinking in their analysis of theories, institutions, and processes.",
