In order to help students build a portfolio of figure drawings for transfer or to help find work in one of the many fields that require figure drawing, this course moves beyond observation and emphasizes creative, conceptual, & theoretical development. This course provides advanced instruction in drawing the human figure from the live model as well of use of the figure in work that students create. Emphasis will be on developing self-directed student work. Course exercises will cover advanced surface musculature and skeletal anatomy, but will also develop students’ repertoire of medias and deepen exploration of the figure in drawing.
