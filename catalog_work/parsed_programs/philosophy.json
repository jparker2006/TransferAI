By studying philosophy, students confront questions and problems both theoretical and practical about themselves and their relation to the world. Philosophy courses rigorously examine the basic assumptions of every human endeavor — from seeking knowledge to deciding what is right or wrong — thereby enriching students’ understanding of what it means to be human and preparing them to think critically for a lifetime.",
