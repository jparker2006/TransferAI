  "program_description": "Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry analyzing structures of power, especially as they are grounded in gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, ability, and other sources of inequalities. The students who enroll in these courses gain the opportunity to understand how social forces, organized around the central concept of gender, shape both themselves as individuals and the world around them. Students have the opportunity to attain a fuller understanding of human behavior, culture, and society made possible by investigating women’s lives, as well as the lives of other marginalized groups, and acquaint themselves with the experience of subordinate genders of various economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.",

Employing feminist theories and feminist analysis, this course examines the relationship between women, gender, sexuality and popular culture. Students will examine historical and contemporary images and roles of women in popular culture (including print, film, television, music, advertising, and consumerism) and situate these images and roles within changing socio-historical, political, and economic contexts. The intersection of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation is examined throughout the course and the relationship between popular culture and feminist movements is emphasized.",
