  "program_name": "Architecture",
  "program_description": "See also “Interior Architectural Design” The Architecture program provides an analytical foundation from which you will explore design innovation through functional, cultural, environmental, and socially conscious design. Learn about the impact of the built environment while developing skills in drafting, rendering, presentations, project collaboration, environmental design, building systems, and code compliance. Explore creative careers in digital production or environmental design for a sustainable future. Our instructors are experienced professionals who bring first-hand knowledge of industry practices to the classroom and work in close collaboration with industry advisors to keep up with trends and changing requirements. In addition, participating companies often provide guest speakers and student internships. We offer day, evening and weekend classes to provide educational opportunities to all students. In addition, selected Architecture courses are offered online through SMC’s Distance Education program. Students who are interested in the Architecture program are strongly encouraged to schedule an appointment with one of the counselors at the Center for Media and Design campus to develop an Educational Plan. This is to ensure that you are taking the necessary courses to meet your educational goals. To learn more, please visit smc.edu/designtech.",
