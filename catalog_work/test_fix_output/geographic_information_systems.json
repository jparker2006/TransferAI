We use GIS to combine various geospatial information in a digital environment to answer the questions “what is there?” and “why there?” GIS has been widely used in our daily life, government agencies, as well as organizations of sizes in almost every industry. There is a growing interest in and awareness of the economic and strategic values of GIS.",
