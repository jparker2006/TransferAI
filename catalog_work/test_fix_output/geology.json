  "program_name": "Geology",
  "program_description": "Geology is an interdisciplinary science that integrates the principles of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the social sciences to explore and understand the Earth. Geology asks and answers questions about the Earth, including its origins, composition, structure, and past and present activity and the impact of these factors on society. As a science with pragmatic applications it is also applied to locate resources and assess their abundance, to mitigate geologic hazards, and to provide critical information about Earthâ€™s changing climate and the impact of these changes on our ecosystems. A degree in geology can translate to a number of important and highly valued academic and professional positions, including but not limited to, Earth scientist (e.g. geologist, seismologist, volcanologist, oceanographer, soil scientist, hydrologist, etc.), environmental consultant, environmental lawyer, remediation specialist, climate scientist, and teacher.",
