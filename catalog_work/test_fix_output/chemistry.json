  "program_description": "Chemists study the properties of matter and make qualitative and quantitative analysis of many substances. They conduct a variety of experiments and tests in laboratories to develop new knowledge or maintain control over the quality of existing products and procedures. Chemists may work in research and development, or production and quality control in the chemical manufacturing industry, and in education or government institutions. Students must be present at the first lab session of a chemistry course to be assured of admission to limited lab spaces. Students who wish to enroll in a chemistry course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for the course prior to enrollment. Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a C or better. If currently enrolled in a prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed with a C or better. Students who have successfully completed one or more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses. Some of the courses listed in this section are accompanied by Supplemental Instruction. Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic assistance program that utilizes free peer-assisted weekly study sessions to help students learn the most difficult course content. For more information, please see the SI website at smc.edu/si.",

Students who successfully complete this course will understand basic chemical principles and how these principles relate to the Earth’s natural systems and cycles, with emphasis on humanity’s impact on Earth’s natural environments. Students will gain a scientific understanding of the impact of human activity on natural systems and sustainability. Students will also learn common laboratory techniques, including the safe handling of chemicals and the proper use of laboratory equipment, as they analyze environmental problems and solutions. Students enrolling in this course should have math skills equivalent to those entering MATH 31. This course does not fulfill the prerequisite for CHEM 11.",
