A conflict exists if any part of a MATH 8 meeting falls within that MW 9:00-10:25 window. 4) Produce a concise JSON summary with keys: \"top_instructors\" (array of instructor names), \"non_conflicting_sections\" (array of objects with section_number, days, time_range, instructor), and \"rationale\" (one-sentence explanation)."
