(2) The output from ratings_physics8 listing ratings, difficulty, and comments for instructors teaching PHYSCS 8. (3) The student's existing course HIST 1 meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 AM to 10:55 AM. Task: (a) Identify all PHYSCS 8 sections whose scheduled meeting times do NOT overlap with the Tuesday/Thursday 9:30â€“10:55 AM slot. Ignore sections with \"Arrange\" or online only meetings when checking conflicts. (b) Among the non-conflicting sections, determine which instructor has the highest overall rating (use overall rating first, then would-take-again % as a tiebreaker). (c) Produce a concise recommendation specifying the section number(s) that avoid the conflict and highlighting the instructor with the best ratings, including their key rating metrics."
