  "program_description": "Astronomers and astrophysicists study the contents of our universe, including planets, stars, galaxies, and even the universe in its entirety. They are essentially physicists who specialize in using the fundamental laws of nature and the techniques of mathematics to understand our place in the cosmos. Astronomers design and build telescopes and other scientific instruments to collect data from astronomical objects. They then apply the techniques of scientific data reduction and analysis to extract the information from the data collected. While many astronomers and astrophysicists end up in academia, their unique skills are in great demand in many other fields including, aerospace, engineering, computer science, software development, information technology, financial services, education, and public outreach.",

In the lab component, students begin by re-creating many historical, first-ever human discoveries and measurements that helped to develop the scientific method: the size of Earth, Moon, and Sun, their relative distances, the scale of planetary orbits, phases, diameters, densities, masses, surface features, atmospheres, and rates of rotation. The labs also engage students in basic observations of the sky, computer simulations, and analysis of archival data from public domain sky surveys and surface maps by robotic NASA rovers and orbiting probes. The course material is a single semester survey of the origin and evolution of planetary systems such as our own Solar System including the latest leading theories of planetary topography, atmospheres, interiors, moons, comets, asteroids, and aurorae produced by the interaction of planetary magnetism and particle outflows from the Sun.",

      "description": "This course will stress naked-eye astronomy and the historical development of astronomical thought, from the stone age to modern times. Students will learn about celestial motions and how these motions have shaped various cultural views, and how cultural beliefs and values shaped interpretations of the phenomena seen. We will see how eclipses of the sun and moon helped mark important epochs of time, and how solar and lunar motions were used to help create calendars. The class will study the development of astronomy in western European cultures, American cultures (North America, Mesoamerica, and South America), and non-western cultures (Asia, Africa).",
