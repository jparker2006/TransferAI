Pure mathematicians develop the theories to further the science of mathematics. Possible careers include actuary, computer engineer, cryptographer, satellite communications expert, robotics programmer, statistician and teacher. Students new to the Santa Monica College mathematics program who wish to enroll in a course should see the placement tab in their Corsair connect account. Mathematics placement based on high school GPA and highest math class taken in high school, or through Guided Self Placement (GSP). A student who has successfully completed college level math courses (earned a grade of C or better) at another institution may be able to verify having met prerequisites by submitting an official transcript. Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a grade of “C” or better.",

      "description": "STAT C1000 is an introduction to statistical thinking and processes, including methods and concepts for discovery and decision-making using data. Topics include descriptive statistics; probability and sampling distributions; statistical inference; correlation and linear regression; analysis of variance, chi-squared, and t-tests; and application of technology for statistical analysis including the interpretation of the relevance of the statistical findings. Students apply methods and processes to applications using data from a broad range of disciplines. MATH 54C is a review of the core prerequisite skills, competencies, and concepts needed in statistics. Intended for students who are concurrently enrolled in STAT C1000, Introduction to Statistics. Topics include: concepts from arithmetic, pre-algebra, elementary and intermediate algebra that are needed to understand the basics of college-level statistics. Concepts are taught through the context of descriptive data analysis. Pass/No Pass only. CO-ENROLLMENT",

Topics include sets and counting, probability, linear systems, linear programming, statistics, and mathematics of finance, with emphasis on applications. The corequisite Math 21C provides a review of the core prerequisite skills, competencies, and concepts needed for students who are concurrently enrolled in Finite Mathematics. Topics include theory, procedures, and practices from pre-algebra, beginning algebra, and intermediate algebra. Particular attention is paid to solving and graphing linear equations and inequalities, problem-solving and modeling strategies, translating and interpreting language for the purpose of formulating mathematical phrases and statements, simplifying arithmetic and algebraic expressions, and learning to use the appropriate technology (typically scientific calculators) needed in Math 21.
