Students will encounter core concepts related to processes of global connection and change, while also developing basic geographic literacy in the distribution of human and natural features on Earth. Students will examine and discuss significant issues — cultural, social, political-economic, and environmental — impacting humanity today as both problem and possibility. In particular, this course considers the diverse localized impacts of globalization as a continuing story of peoples and places isolated and connected by imperial, colonial, and international systems of the past and present.",
