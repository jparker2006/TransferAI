In this introduction to the humanities students will survey literature in conjunction with great works of art through the ages (painting, sculpture, music, architecture, dance) exploring how, at widely separated points in time, artists and writers have expressed and responded to cultural, political, and intellectual concerns of their day. In doing so, they will see literature in the context of other art forms. HUM 26 is the same course as ENGL 26. Credit may be earned for one, but not both.",
