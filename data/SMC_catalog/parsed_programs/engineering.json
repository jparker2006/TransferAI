Their work is the link between scientific discoveries and commercial applications. Engineers design products, the machinery to build those products, the factories in which those products are made, and the systems that ensure the quality of the product and efficiency of the workforce and manufacturing process. There are a variety of engineering fields: electrical, mechanical, civil, industrial, aeronautical, chemical, materials, nuclear, petroleum and mining engineering.",
