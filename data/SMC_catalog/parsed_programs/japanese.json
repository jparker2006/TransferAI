The course also familiarizes students of different registers (spoken vs. written) and writing styles (“desu/masu” vs. essay). Reading materials include semiauthentic articles on specific topics and writing focuses on styles as well as multiple paragraph organization. Traditional and current aspects of the Japanese culture are explored throughout the course and studied in reading. This course is taught in Japanese unless in cases of linguistic difficulty as determined by the professor. .",
