  "program_description": "Ethnic Studies is the interdisciplinary critical and comparative study of race and ethnicity, focusing on the experiences of African American, Native American/Indigenous, Asian American/Pacific Islander, and Chicana/o/x/Latina/o/x populations. Ethnic Studies provides an intersectional and critical lens for studying racial, ethnic, gender and class identities, and for interrogating structural racism, power, knowledge, and racialization in culture, politics, economy, and law. Drawing from the intellectual traditions of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) communities, students of Ethnic Studies attain an understanding of the historical legacies and contemporary manifestations of racism, discrimination, inequity, and movements for social justice. Through culturally responsive pedagogy, students of Ethnic Studies gain cultural competency and are exposed to perspectives and methods informed by a deep commitment to social justice, cross-cultural collaboration, liberation from systems of oppression, and social and institutional transformation.",

      "description": "Ethnic Studies is the critical and interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity with a focus on the experiences and perspectives of Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, Latina/o/x Americans, and other people of color within and beyond the United States. This course explores key theories, scholarly works, and ideas that have formed the basis of the broad multidisciplinary field of Ethnic Studies. Various perspectives are examined to discover the ways in which race and racism have been, and continue to be, powerful social, cultural and political forces, and their connections to other axes of stratification including gender, class, sexuality and legal status. This course examines the effects of institutional racism, coloniality, marginalization, socio-economic and political discrimination, and ethnocentrism on American ethnic and racial groups.",
