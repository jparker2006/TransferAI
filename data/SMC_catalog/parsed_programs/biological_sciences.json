  "program_description": "See also “Aquaculture.” Coursework and study in the biological sciences provides a foundation for future employment in many of the fastest growing and emerging STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields today. Students of biology are at the front lines of many of the most critical questions our society is facing in the 21st century and beyond, including addressing climate change, the biodiversity crisis, resource management and population growth, emerging/infectious diseases and public health. Students of biology become lab technicians, nurses, genetic counselors, physicians, environmental scientists, landscape architects, state and national park rangers, researchers in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, teachers and college professors. Logic and critical thinking skills developed as a student of biology are applicable to nearly every field and every discipline and provide a foundation for making informed personal, business and public policy decisions. Students must be present for the first session of biological science classes to be assured of admission to limited laboratory spaces. Students who wish to enroll in a Life Sciences course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for the course prior to enrollment. Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a C or better. If currently enrolled in a prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed with a C or better. Students who have successfully completed one or more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses.",

      "description": "This course is an intensive study of the gross and microscopic structure of the human body including the four major types of tissue and their subgroups, and the following organ systems: integumentary, skeletal, muscular, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory. Functions of the organ systems are included at the introductory level to prepare students for a course in Human Physiology. Laboratory assignments develop the skills of observation, investigation, identification, discovery and dissection. The use of actual specimens, including cat dissection and observation of a human cadaver, is emphasized to assure that students learn the relative structure, functions, textures and variations in tissues not incorporated in models. Supplemental materials such as models, photographs, charts, videotapes, and digitized images are also provided. This course is required for students preparing for many Allied Health professions including, but not limited to, Nursing, Respiratory Therapy, Physical Therapy, Physical Education and Kinesiology Training, and Physician’s Assistant and is a prerequisite for Human Physiology 3.",

This course is designed to prepare students to enter the growing biotechnology workforce or to transfer. Students that complete this course will be eligible to take the Los Angeles Regional Bioscience/Biotechnology Industry-Valued Credential. Topics explored in this course include basic molecular and cellular biology, introductory genetics, biomanufacturing, microbiology, agriculture & bioremediation, chemistry, environmental health & safety, quality assurance & regulation, business, ethics, and biotechnology company structure. These concepts are explored by means of class discussions and projects, reading assignments, and lab activities. The course is intended as preparation for the intermediate and advanced biotechnology skills and methods courses as well as internships. By the end of the course, students should be able to describe the general structure and operating practices for a biotechnology company, demonstrate knowledge of fundamental biotechnology concepts in a molecular biology context, and express understanding of biotechnology applications and ethical practices.",

Immigration, enculturation, acculturation, religion, food availability, food preference, food behavior, food preparation, food beliefs and food-related gender roles are considered. These factors are compared and contrasted across the ethnic groups and regions in America. The impact of “Americanization” on ethnic cuisines and impact of ethnic cuisines on the American economy are explored. Current research on the healthand nutritionrelated implications of ethnic groups’ food choices/practices is reviewed. Engendering cultural sensitivity and competency is at the core of this course.",
