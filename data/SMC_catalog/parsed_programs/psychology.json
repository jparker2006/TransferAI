      "description": "This course will focus on the theory and application of psychological principles as they relate to the causes of, and potential solutions to, current global environmental problems. Modern ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss, etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the mental mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolutionary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways by which the clash of a “universal human nature” and the modern environment results in an “evolutionary mismatch.” Evolutionary models such as the “tragedy of the commons” will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind’s social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cognitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human-environment interaction.",

This upper division Cognitive Psychology course addresses how humans learn to process information in their environment as well as how they decide how and when to act on their environment. This course includes a survey of cognitive psychology, specifically, the science and study of how people acquire, represent, transform and use verbal and nonverbal information. In this context we will explore sensation and perception of objects, surfaces, space, and motion. Additionally, key cognitive functions are explored including imagery, memory, representations of knowledge, language, decision making, thinking and reasoning, attention and vigilance. Finally, we will review developmental considerations in cognitive psychology from early infant cognition to maturation and cognition as we age.",
