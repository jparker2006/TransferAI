=Astronomy
Astronomers and astrophysicists study the contents of our universe,
including planets, stars, galaxies, and even the universe in its entirety.
They are essentially physicists who specialize in using the fundamental
laws of nature and the techniques of mathematics to understand our
place in the cosmos. Astronomers design and build telescopes and
other scientific instruments to collect data from astronomical objects.
They then apply the techniques of scientific data reduction and analy-
sis to extract the information from the data collected. While many
astronomers and astrophysicists end up in academia, their unique
skills are in great demand in many other fields including, aerospace, engineering, computer science, software development, information technology, financial services, education, and public outreach.

*Maximum credit allowed for ASTRON 2 and ASTRON 4 is one course (4 units).
This is a 4-unit introductory level lab course with a similar
curricular depth and breadth to its comparable 3-unit lecture
course Astronomy 2. In the lab component, students begin by re-creating many historical, first-ever human discoveries and
measurements that helped to develop the scientific method:
the size of Earth, Moon, and Sun, their relative distances,
the scale of planetary orbits, phases, diameters, densities,
masses, surface features, atmospheres, and rates of rota-
tion. The labs also engage students in basic observations of
the sky, computer simulations, and analysis of archival data
from public domain sky surveys and surface maps by robotic
NASA rovers and orbiting probes. The course material is a
single semester survey of the origin and evolution of plan-
etary systems such as our own Solar System including the latest leading theories of planetary topography, atmospheres,
interiors, moons, comets, asteroids, and aurorae produced by
the interaction of planetary magnetism and particle outflows from the Sun.

=Biological Sciences
See also “Aquaculture.”
Coursework and study in the biological sciences provides a founda-
tion for future employment in many of the fastest growing and
emerging STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields
today. Students of biology are at the front lines of many of the
most critical questions our society is facing in the 21st century and
beyond, including addressing climate change, the biodiversity crisis, resource management and population growth, emerging/infectious
diseases and public health. Students of biology become lab techni- cians, nurses, genetic counselors, physicians, environmental scientists,
landscape architects, state and national park rangers, researchers in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, teachers and college
professors. Logic and critical thinking skills developed as a student
of biology are applicable to nearly every field and every discipline
and provide a foundation for making informed personal, business
and public policy decisions. Students must be present for the first
session of biological science classes to be assured of admission to lim-
ited laboratory spaces. Students who wish to enroll in a Life Sciences
course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for
the course prior to enrollment. Continuing students must complete
prerequisite courses with a C or better. If currently enrolled in a
prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will
be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement
results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed
with a C or better. Students who have successfully completed one or
more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the
lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at
another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites
by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses.

=Economics
Economics is the study of how society allocates scarce resources. The
goal is to understand the decisions of businesses and consumers as
well as the implications and causes of contemporary economic issues
by developing a systematic and thorough understanding of precisely
how economic systems operate. Courses in the discipline of econom-
ics study the structure of markets and economies, the relationship
between regions within the global economy, and strive to convey how
economists reason and how they analyze models and compare model implications to observations.
Some of the courses listed in this section are accompanied by
Supplemental Instruction. Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an aca-
demic assistance program that utilizes free peer-assisted weekly study
sessions to help students learn the most difficult course content. For

=ESL – English as a Second Language
English for Second Language Speakers courses are designed spe-
cifically for students whose first language is not English. SMC offers
three different ESL programs: 1) Credit ESL courses focus on academic
skills needed for success in college (reading textbooks, listening and
notetaking, writing papers with citations, speaking in class in small
groups, and making presentations). Faculty assist students in the development of grammar, vocabulary, paraphrasing, and summariz-
ing skills within the context of themes or academic content. ESL 19A
and 19B are CSU and UC transferable (up to 8 units). 2) Noncredit
ESL courses focus on college and career readiness and developing the
skills needed for life and work in the US. Noncredit ESL courses are
free to students, except those studying on an F-1 visa. These courses
do not carry any academic credit. 3) Intensive ESL (offered through
SMC’s Community Services Program in conjunction with International
Education) offers multi-skills courses to prepare international students
for entry to Santa Monica College. Student work is graded, but courses
in the Intensive ESL Program do not receive academic credit. These courses are offered for a fee.
For the following classes, placement is required to determine class
placement. See smc.edu/successcenter. Most sections of ESL classes

• Satisfies Global Citizenship
This course will focus on the theory and application of psycho-
logical principles as they relate to the causes of, and potential solutions to, current global environmental problems. Modern
ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss,
etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class
will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the men-
tal mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolution-
ary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways
by which the clash of a “universal human nature” and the modern environment results in an “evolutionary mismatch.”
Evolutionary models such as the “tragedy of the commons”
will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In
addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effec-
tively reshape human kind’s social, technological and eco-
nomic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems
approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of,
as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research
will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cog-
nitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human- environment interaction.
ENVRN 40 is the same course as PSYCH 40. Students may earn credit for one but not both.

=Ethnic Studies
Ethnic Studies is the interdisciplinary critical and comparative study of
race and ethnicity, focusing on the experiences of African American,
Native American/Indigenous, Asian American/Pacific Islander, and
Chicana/o/x/Latina/o/x populations. Ethnic Studies provides an inter-
sectional and critical lens for studying racial, ethnic, gender and class
identities, and for interrogating structural racism, power, knowledge,
and racialization in culture, politics, economy, and law. Drawing from
the intellectual traditions of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color)
communities, students of Ethnic Studies attain an understanding of
the historical legacies and contemporary manifestations of racism,
discrimination, inequity, and movements for social justice. Through
culturally responsive pedagogy, students of Ethnic Studies gain
cultural competency and are exposed to perspectives and methods
informed by a deep commitment to social justice, cross-cultural col-
laboration, liberation from systems of oppression, and social and institutional transformation.

which race and racism have been, and continue to be, power-
ful social, cultural and political forces, and their connections
to other axes of stratification including gender, class, sexuality
and legal status. This course examines the effects of institu- tional racism, coloniality, marginalization, socio-economic and political discrimination, and ethnocentrism on American ethnic and racial groups.

=Geography
Geography is the science of studying human and physical attributes
on the surface of the Earth. These attributes may be marks of
human occupation, properties of some natural environment, or both.
Geographers ask the questions “Where” and “Why there”, with an
interest in describing and explaining the various ways in which people
have made Earth their home at scales ranging from the local to the
global. Geography is an integrative discipline whose interests in space
and place and whose perspectives from both environmental and
social sciences foster a greater understanding of the interrelation-
ships between the human and physical worlds. The use of Geo-Spatial
Technologies, including Geographic Information Science (GIS), Remote
Sensing (RS), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), are now widely
used in the visualization, measurement and analysis of Earth’s physi-
cal features and human societies, as well as the interaction between them.

=Geology
Geology is an interdisciplinary science that integrates the principles
of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the social sciences
to explore and understand the Earth. Geology asks and answers ques-
tions about the Earth, including its origins, composition, structure, and
past and present activity and the impact of these factors on society.
As a science with pragmatic applications it is also applied to locate
resources and assess their abundance, to mitigate geologic hazards,
and to provide critical information about Earth’s changing climate and
the impact of these changes on our ecosystems. A degree in geology
can translate to a number of important and highly valued academic
and professional positions, including but not limited to, Earth scien- tist (e.g. geologist, seismologist, volcanologist, oceanographer, soil scientist, hydrologist, etc.), environmental consultant, environmental lawyer, remediation specialist, climate scientist, and teacher.

• Satisfies Global Citizenship
This course is an introduction to the study of language. It pro-
vides an overview of the field of linguistics, its three dimen-
sions of language structure: the sound system (phonetics and phonology), vocabulary (morphology), and grammar (syntax),
and the way linguistic structure and context give rise to
meaning (semantics and pragmatics). In addition the course
considers how social practices are shaped by and shape lan-
guage use, as well as how language is acquired and learned.
The course provides a grounding in linguistics as a field of
study, basic analytic skills for viewing and discussing language
from a variety of perspectives, and greater awareness of the relevance of language across and within cultures.

=Media Studies
Media is a versatile discipline consisting of two areas of study: media
studies and media production. Our media studies area focuses on the
analysis of the mass media. Media Studies courses use an analytical
and historical approach, and students develop skills to assess the role
and impact of mass media on society. Students examine the history,
values, and structure of media in the US and internationally. Media
literacy skills are another fundamental component of Media Studies
Courses. Upon successful completion of our Media Studies courses,
each student should leave as a media literate individual — a more
aware, critical audience member with a well-developed sense of
mass media’s role in society. There is a wide range of employment
possibilities for students trained in Media Studies, including positions
in public relations, business, sales, public and personnel relations, and
advertising. Our Media Production courses provide hands-on training
in the areas of Television, Radio and Internet Broadcasting, including
broadcast news, sports, promotional videos, podcasting, short form
and emerging media (360/virtual and augmented reality). Students
completing the Broadcasting degrees and/or certificates are prepared
for both employment opportunities in the broadcasting industry and
transfer into four-year degree programs. The Promo Pathways pro-
gram provides intensive training and internships for students pursuing
promo advertising careers opportunities in the broadcasting industry and transfer into four-year degree programs.

Transfer: UC, CSU
Cal-GETC Area 4 (Social & Behavioral Sciences)
• Satisfies Global Citizenship
This course will focus on the theory and application of psycho-
logical principles as they relate to the causes of, and potential solutions to, current global environmental problems. Modern
ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss,
etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class
will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the men-
tal mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolution-
ary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways
by which the clash of a “universal human nature” and the modern environment results in an “evolutionary mismatch.”
Evolutionary models such as the “tragedy of the commons”
will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In
addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effec-
tively reshape human kind’s social, technological and eco-
nomic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems
approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of,
as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research
will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cog-
nitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human- environment interaction.
PSYCH 40 is the same course as ENVRN 40. Students may earn credit for one but not both.

=Urban Studies
Urban Studies is an interdisciplinary investigation of our dynamic
world of cities and their suburbs. From points of view ranging from
the local to the global, students in this field examine cities as com-
plex social groupings of people and institutions, as well as cultural
landscapes of buildings, pathways, and public and private spaces.
Urban Studies is concerned with what cities are and have been, as
well as with ever-changing ideas about what cities could and should
be. Urban Studies prepares students for careers in fields such as urban planning, architecture, public policy, and real-estate development,
and it informs discussions of issues such as housing, transportation, urban renewal, segregation, sustainability, and suburban sprawl.
URBAN 8, INTRODUCTION TO URBAN STUDIES 3 UNITS
Transfer: UC, CSU
Cal-GETC Area 4 (Social & Behavioral Sciences)

spaces. Attention is paid to what cities are and have been (the
evolving urban experience of the past and present) as well as
to ever-changing ideas about what cities should be (urban
planning and design for the future). While the overall perspec-
tive of the course is global, its primary focus is on the cities of
North America and, in particular, the Los Angeles metropoli-
tan area. This emphasis is evident both in the classroom and
in field trips or other assignments that ask students to apply classroom ideas to our local urban setting.

=Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary field of
inquiry analyzing structures of power, especially as they are grounded
in gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, ability, and other
sources of inequalities. The students who enroll in these courses gain
the opportunity to understand how social forces, organized around
the central concept of gender, shape both themselves as individuals
and the world around them. Students have the opportunity to attain
a fuller understanding of human behavior, culture, and society made
possible by investigating women’s lives, as well as the lives of other
marginalized groups, and acquaint themselves with the experience
of subordinate genders of various economic, ethnic, and racial back- grounds.

This course utilizes the lens of feminist theories to critically
analyze how popular culture constructs gender and sexual-
ity and how these constructions become cultural norms and
values. Employing feminist theories and feminist analysis, this course examines the relationship between women, gender,
sexuality and popular culture. Students will examine histori-
cal and contemporary images and roles of women in popular culture (including print, film, television, music, advertising,
and consumerism) and situate these images and roles within changing socio-historical, political, and economic contexts.
The intersection of gender, race, class, and sexual orienta-
tion is examined throughout the course and the relationship
