# UCSD Transfer Major Preparation

This folder contains major preparation requirements and course recommendations for transferring to UC San Diego. The data includes prerequisite courses, GPA requirements, and program-specific transfer guidelines. 

Note for ucsd_transfer_majors.json
    Starting at the Computer Engineering major, specialization is no longer listed, and formatting  
    of courses changes from listing all courses in the same subject as one element to listing all courses
    as independent elements even if of the same overarching subject. Should not be a problem for training.
