## Canvas and Account Access

### I can't find my Class in Canvas

For an online/hybrid class that is being hosted on Canvas your login will NOT be available until the first day of the class. When you add a class with an add code or reinstate code, you will not be able to access the course until the next day.

### I can't login to Canvas

Students need to follow these instructions carefully: Username is your SMC email without @student.smc.edu or @smc.edu. Do not use your student ID. Example: Your username is lee_jane_doe if your email is lee_jane_doe@student.smc.edu or lee_jane_doe@smc.edu Password is your regular SMC password, the same one you use for Corsair Connect.

### Why does Canvas say "no such account" when I try to Login?

Students who are new to Canvas, will not have access until two weeks before the term begins. If a student registers after the term begins, it takes Canvas 24 hours to create an account, so you will not be able to access the course until the next day.

### My Password is Not Working

If your password does not work, open Notepad on PC or Text Edit on Mac, type your password and copy this password. Test your password in Corsair Connect and paste it in Canvas to ensure they are the same.

## Class Format and Schedule

### How do I Enroll in an Online Class?

The enrollment process is the same for online and on-ground classes and takes place in your Corsair Connect account. You may try to self-enroll in a class at any time up to the night before the first day of the class.

*Keywords: enroll, online, class, enrollment, process*

### Why was I dropped from my online class?

If you were not active in the class and/or missed assignments, the professor is required to drop you. Online classes require substantive participation. This means that if you do not regularly and thoughtfully participate in the class activities defined in your course syllabus, you risk being dropped.
