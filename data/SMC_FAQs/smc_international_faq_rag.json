It is ultimately the student’s responsibility to drop themselves by the established deadlines if they no longer wish to remain in a class or risk getting a failing grade. For students whose attendance is inconsistent, instructors may drop them if the number of absences exceeds the amount allowed by the instructor.",

Keep in mind that some instructors are unwilling to allow for make-up work or exams no matter what the reason. Instructors generally let students know their policy on make-up work at the beginning of the class. If the illness or unforeseen event occurs at the end of the semester or session where only the final is needed, the student may want to discuss with the instructor the possibility of getting an incomplete for the course. Incompletes must be approved by the instructor. If you have a medical condition that is making it difficult for you to study full time, submit a Medical Reduced Course Load (opens in new window) form to the International Education Center within 3 weeks of the beginning of your illness/injury and no later than the end of the semester.",

These feelings are very common for students studying abroad for the first time and with over 3,000 international students, our counselors have had lots of experience assisting our students.

      "answer": "You need to meet with a counselor immediately to discuss your continued status at SMC. If you are placed on probation, you will be limited to 12 units but will be allowed to continue your studies for one more semester. If you fail to improve your grades and are disqualified, you will be asked to sit out for one or more semesters. Again, if you reach this point, you are advised to meet with a counselor to discuss your options. It may be possible to appeal your disqualification and continue attending SMC. Students who earn a D or F in a class may repeat the class once more without any approvals. If you fail it again and wish to retake it, you will need to complete a Special Consideration petition at the International Education Counseling Center. A decision will be made to allow or deny the repetition at SMC. If your request to repeat the class a second time is denied, you may be advised to repeat the class at another college.",

      "question": "How will I be graded in my classes at SMC?",
      "answer": "At the beginning of each class, instructors will usually distribute a course syllabus explaining how students will be graded for the class. Some instructors may place heavy emphasis on factors such as attendance and class participation in addition to actual grades on exams and homework. It is important for students to become familiar with each instructor’s policy, especially with regard to missed exams and assignments due to illness or other reason. These policies tend to vary widely among instructors. Final grades are assigned in one of two ways. Most common are letter grades of A, B, C, D or F, with A representing the highest mark. Less common is a grade of P or NP for pass or no pass. P represents a passing grade of either A, B or C. NP represents a failing grade of D or F. With the exception of a few classes such as Counseling 11, the pass/no pass grading option must be completed through your Corsair Connect. All students will be responsible to elect pass/no pass grading option for the class they want to select. Before requesting pass/no pass, we recommend students meet with a counselor.",

      "answer": "F-1 visa students are eligible to apply for private scholarships through the SMC Foundation once they have completed 12 units at SMC. Scholarships are limited and amounts generally range from around $200 on up. Besides private scholarships, F-1 students enrolled full-time in a minimum of 12 units may also apply for part-time student assistant jobs on campus. If the financial situation of a student’s sponsor changes dramatically after the first year of study and the sponsor is no longer able to provide for the student, the student may be eligible to apply for an off-campus work permit through the International Education Center. If granted an off-campus work permit, students will be allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours per week.",

Job opportunities are listed on the Student Employment website. Note: F-1 students can only apply for jobs designated as Student Help positions. Those positions designated as Federal Work Study are reserved for students on U.S. government financial aid. Students who are offered a job are then given the necessary paperwork to apply for their Social Security Card. A social security number is required before a student can begin working. If a student does not have a social security number and is offered a Student Help position on campus, a staff member at International Education Center will advise the student on how to obtain their social security number.",
