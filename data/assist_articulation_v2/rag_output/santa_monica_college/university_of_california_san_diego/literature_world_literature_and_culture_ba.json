      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation.For information about the Department of Literature, including checklists of lower-division and upper-division requirements for all of our majors, descriptions of current courses and current class schedules, please go to: http://literature.ucsd.edu/.Students electing the World Literature and Culture major can complete the majority of the lower-division requirements at most community colleges in California. A three-quarter lower-division literature sequence is required, and there are many sequence options (see below).As with all of the literature majors offered at UCSD, there is a secondary language and literature requirement (see choices of languages below). This entails required study in a language other than English and the attainment of proficiency in that language through the terminal course in that particular language sequence. For students choosing to concentrate in a foreign language within the major, English literature courses may be used to fulfill the secondary language and literature requirement. For details on the secondary language &amp; literature requirement, please go to http://literature.ucsd.edu/. Students can prepare for this requirement by taking lower-division courses (enough to reach fluency level, usually one to two years) in American Sign Language, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Latin, Russian, Spanish, or English (for students concentrating on a foreign language within the major requirements).World Literature and Culture majors are required to complete: 1) A three-quarter lower-division sequence. Examples of some options include: LTEN 21, 22, 23LTEN 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 (any three)LTWL 19A, 19B, 19CLTFR 2A, 2B, 2CLTGM 2A, 2B, 2CLTGK 1, 2, 3LTIT 2A, 2B, 50LTKO 2A, 2B, 2CLTLA 1, 2, 3LTRU 2A, 2B,104ALTSP 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E2) The secondary language and literature requirement in the chosen language. \ufeffSee appropriate lower-division articulated community college courses below."
