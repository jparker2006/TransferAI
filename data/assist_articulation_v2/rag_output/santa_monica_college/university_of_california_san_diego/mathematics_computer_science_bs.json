      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2018, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrepThe program provides for a major in the mathematical theory that forms the foundation of modern computer science. As a major within the Department of Mathematics, it is strongly devoted to advanced mathematics (algorithm design, combinatorics, logic, probability, numerical analysis and computability). It is not equivalent to an engineering degree. It is appropriate both for those who want to enter directly into the work force and for those who want to pursue graduate study in Computer Science.For more information please visit https://math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/ma30-math-computer-science-b-s/ NOTE: Students who have taken a vector calculus course at a non-UC college must successfully petition the course for 20E equivalency. Petitions must generally include course syllabus, textbook information and final exam. More information on the petition process for 20Ecan be found at the following site: https://www.math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/math-20e-equivalency"
