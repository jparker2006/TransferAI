The explosion of data is transforming nearly every business function to incorporate data in its retrospective analyses, current decisions and future forecasts. The Business Analytics minor curriculum exposes students to four key learning goals: fundamental frameworks and principles of data analysis, wide exposure to a variety of business analytics applications, hands-on training with modern data analysis toolkits, and the generalizable ability to repeatedly learn and apply challenging mathematical frameworks.\ufeffFor more information please visit Undergraduate Minors | UCSD Rady School of Management"
