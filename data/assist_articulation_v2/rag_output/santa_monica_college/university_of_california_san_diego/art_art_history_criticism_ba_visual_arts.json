Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as soon as possible for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. The major in art history, theory, and criticism is designed both for students who desire a broadly-based education in the humanities and for those who plan to pursue a career in an art-related profession. By combining art historical and critical study, the program promotes in the student an awareness of the cultural traditions which have shaped their intellectual outlook and provides a framework for informed judgment on the crucial issues of meaning and expression in contemporary society. Art History honors available for qualified students. For more information please visit visarts.ucsd.edu."
