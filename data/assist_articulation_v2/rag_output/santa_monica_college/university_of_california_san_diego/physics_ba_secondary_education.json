      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2018, major preparation will be required for this major. Transfer major preparation will allow a student to complete the Physics 4 series in their first year at UC San Diego in preparation for the core upper division major program. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep and https://www.physics.ucsd.edu/Student/Prospective/Undergraduate/TransferAdmissions Special Advising Note: For more information about this major, see http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/ and send inquiries to advising@physics.ucsd.edu. \ufeffThe B.A. program provides a broadly based education in the natural sciences. It is a solid preparation for employment in the technical fields as well as for teaching in secondary schools. As a liberal arts degree rooted in analytical rigor and intellectual curiosity, the Physics B.A. has also proven to be one stepping stone toward further education and careers in many diverse professions. (Students who wish to pursue the Ph.D. in Physics should enroll in the B.S. program.)"
