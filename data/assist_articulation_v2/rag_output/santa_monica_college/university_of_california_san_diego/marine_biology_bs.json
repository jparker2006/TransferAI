Effective Fall 2020, transfer major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep. Please also refer to https://scripps.ucsd.edu/undergrad/how-apply for additional information.The courses listed below reflect requirements for transfer major preparation for admission consideration, as well as courses required for the major that may be completed at the community college.Special Advising Note: **While not all lower division major courses in this major are required for transfer major preparation, the Scripps Department encourages Marine Biology transfer studentsto complete as much of the major's lower-division coursework as possible prior to transferring to UC San Diego.The UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography Undergraduate Department offers a Marine Biology major leading to a B.S. degree. As a guiding concept, the focus of the marine biology curriculum is an understanding of the biology of marine organisms and the biological and physical processes that affect these organisms, their populations, and their coastal and oceanic ecosystems.
