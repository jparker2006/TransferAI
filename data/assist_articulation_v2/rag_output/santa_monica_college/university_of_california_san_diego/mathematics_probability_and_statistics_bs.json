      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2018, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep This program is designed for students with substantial interest in probability theory and statistics. It is useful preparation for many fields of employment as well as graduate school. Students who have completed C/C++ Programming may be able to use that course in place of one of the required Java Programming classes listed below. Students should speak with a UCSD Mathematics advisor. For more information please visit https://math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/ma35-probability-statistics-b-s/ NOTE: Students who have taken a vector calculus course at a non-UC college must successfully petition the course for 20E equivalency. Petitions must generally include course syllabus, textbook information and final exam. More information on the petition process for 20E can be found at the following site: https://www.math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/math-20e-equivalency"
