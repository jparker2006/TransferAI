      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep General Advice: Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to Engineering Physics. - Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A) - Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B) - Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C) - Differential Equations (Math. 20D) - Linear Algebra (Math. 18) - Complete calculus-based physics series with lab experience (Physics 2A-B-C-BL or CL) Note: An equivalent to UCSD\u2019s PHYS 2D is strongly recommended although it is not considered for screening purposes. - Chemistry I-for Science and Engineering (Chemistry 6A) - Introductory computer programming language (Java, C, or C++) Note about ECE 15 and ECE 35 credit: If students take a C programming course or circuits course at a non-UC College without an official articulation, they must pass the ECE 15 or 35 Waiver Exam to receive transfer credit for UCSD ECE 15 or 35. These are NOT placement tests. For more information, go to http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/ece-15-35-waiver-examsSpecial Advising Note: All transfer students should understand that the lower-division curriculum is demanding. Transfer students will be required to take all lower-division requirements or their equivalent. The ECE department has a recommended schedule for transfer students (please consult the ECE website, http://www.ece.ucsd.edu, for sample recommended course schedules and for the ECE course requirement guide).NOTE: Articulation of engineering coursework will be subject to thorough review and evaluation."
