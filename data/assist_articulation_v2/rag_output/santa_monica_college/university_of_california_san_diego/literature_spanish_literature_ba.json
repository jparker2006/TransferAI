      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. Students without articulated coursework must take the appropriate placement test. Only placement tests, articulated coursework, or AP/IB scores will determine the students' placement. For information about the Department of Literature, including checklists of lower-division and upper-division requirements for all of our majors, descriptions of current courses and current class schedules, please go to: http://literature.ucsd.edu/. Students electing the Spanish Literature major can complete the majority of lower-division requirements at most community colleges in California. As with all of the literature majors offered at UCSD, there is a secondary language and literature requirement. This entails required study in a language other than Spanish and the attainment of proficiency in that language through the terminal course in that particular language sequence. For details on the secondary language &amp; literature requirement, please go to: http://literature.ucsd.edu/. Students can prepare for this requirement by taking lower-division courses (enough to reach fluency level, usually one to two years) in American Sign Language, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, or Russian. Spanish Literature majors are required to complete: 1) The secondary language and literature requirement in the chosen language. See appropriate lower-division articulated community college courses below."
