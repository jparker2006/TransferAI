      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as soon as possible for their minor before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the minor helps students move efficiently toward graduation. The Rady School of Management\u2019s Entrepreneurship and Innovation (E&amp;I) Minor is designed to provide students with a breadth of understanding of business and entrepreneurship theory, practices and applications. The E&amp;I Minor will appeal to creative and ambitious undergraduate UCSD students who envision launching and managing their own business or entering careers in innovation-driven fields. There are five main goals for the overall curriculum that will be pursued pragmatically: 1) cover a broad context of the application of entrepreneurship and business principles, 2) develop a comprehensive view of innovation within and operations of both established business and start-up business operations, 3) be application-oriented and provide experiential learning opportunities, 4) provide course work in a unique area not available elsewhere on campus, and 5) through course work and faculty guidance, help innovative students cultivate and expand on their business ideas. The curriculum includes a two-course practicum requirement, MGT 121A and MGT 121B Innovation to Market, that will give students the opportunity to apply their knowledge of entrepreneurial theories and innovative thinking strategies in a classroom setting.1.) All courses applied toward the Entrepreneurship and Innovation minor must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better).2.) Information about the Entrepreneurship and Innovation minor is also available at our web site: https://rady.ucsd.edu/programs/undergraduate-programs/entrepreneurship-and-innovation-minor/3.) Of the seven (7) total courses are required for the minor, five (5) must be upper-division. Five of the seven courses in the minor must be taken at UCSD."
