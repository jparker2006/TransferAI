      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrepGeneral Advice: Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to this major.- Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)- Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)- Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)- Differential Equations (Math. 20D)- Linear Algebra (Math. 18)- Complete calculus-based physics series (Physics 2A-B-C) Note: An equivalent to UCSD\u2019s PHYS 2D is strongly recommended although it is not considered for screening purposes.- Chemistry I-for Science and Engineering (Chemistry 6A)- Introductory computer programming language (Java, C, or C++)Note about ECE 15 and ECE 35 credit: If students take a C programming course or circuits course at a non-UC College without an official articulation, they must pass the ECE 15 or 35 Waiver Exam to receive transfer credit for UCSD ECE 15 or 35. These are NOT placement tests. For more information, go to http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/ece-15-35-waiver-examsNOTE: Articulation of engineering coursework will be subject to thorough review and evaluation. Special Advising Note:All transfer students should understand that the lower-division curriculum is demanding. Transfer students will be required to complete all lower-division requirements or their equivalent courses. The ECE department has a recommended schedule for transfer students (please consult the ECE website, http://www.ece.ucsd.edu, for sample recommended course schedules and for the ECE course requirement guide).Note regarding Elective Courses in Social Sciences and Humanities Studies (8 units):These can be prerequisite courses for the upper division depth sequence in social sciences/humanities. For instance, for history studies, this can be two history lower division courses (HILD 2, 7, 10-12). Historically oriented HUM, MMW and CAT courses would count as well. At least one lower division course should have a writing component. For Economics studies, this can be two lower division courses (ECON 1, and ECON 4; for the Finance track); or one lower division course (ECON 1) plus one upper division course; for the Data Analysis track.For political science, the following courses may be utilized: POLI 10, POLI 11, POLI 12, POLI 13, POLI 30. For sociology studies, students will choose two lower-division courses from SOCI 1, 2, and 30, of which 30 is highly recommended."
