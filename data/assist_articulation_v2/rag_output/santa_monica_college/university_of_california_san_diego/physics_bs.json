Transfer major preparation will allow a student to complete the Physics 4 series in their first year at UC San Diego in preparation for the core upper division major program. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep and https://www.physics.ucsd.edu/Student/Prospective/Undergraduate/TransferAdmissions Special Advising Note: For more information about this major, see http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/ and send inquiries to advising@physics.ucsd.edu. \ufeffThe B.S. program provides a basic foundation for students to go on to graduate school in physics or related areas, such as engineering and other physical sciences. It is at the same time a solid preparation for gainful employment in the technical fields."
