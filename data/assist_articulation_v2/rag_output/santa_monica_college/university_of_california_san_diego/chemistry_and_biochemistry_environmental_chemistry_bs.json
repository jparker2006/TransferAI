      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep This major provides a strong chemistry background, but also includes breadth courses from other disciplines related to environmental concerns. The elective courses allow specialization in a secondary area of interest, such as biology, earth sciences, or additional chemistry, and may include courses in economics and political science. The program is designed to prepare students to enter the industrial, governmental, or legal workforce, or to continue studies in the environmental sciences. Students fulfilling their elective requirements with chemistry courses would be prepared to attend most graduate schools in chemical sciences. If American Chemical Society Certification is desired, additional coursework is required. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as possible for their major before enrolling at UCSD. Students should complete all other transfer courses before taking organic chemistry.For more information please visit http://www-chem.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/majors-minor/index.html"
