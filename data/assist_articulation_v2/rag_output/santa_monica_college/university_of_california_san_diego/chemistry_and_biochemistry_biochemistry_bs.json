      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep This major focuses on the chemical processes in living organisms, including structure and function of nucleic acids and proteins. It is suitable for those planning to go to graduate school, as well as medical, dental, veterinary and other professional schools. It is also suitable at the bachelor's level for jobs in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields. This program is certified by the American Chemical Society. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as possible for their major before enrolling at UCSD. Students should complete all other transfer courses before taking organic chemistry. For more information please visit http://www-chem.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/majors-minor/index.html"
