      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. \ufeffThe Theatre major provides a student with a solid artistic and academic background. The required lower-division courses equip the student with the skills and knowledge necessary for more advanced work in each of the areas of study. The major is structured to respond to the needs of students who seek a broad-based liberal arts education in theatre as well as those who plan to pursue their studies at the graduate level with the aim of acquiring either an M.F.A. or Ph.D. degree. Students should meet with the department's undergraduate coordinator the quarter in which they declare a theatre major in order to plan an appropriate individual course of study. For more information please visit https://theatre.ucsd.edu/admissions/undergraduate/theatre-major.html NOTE: Theatre majors are required to do two practicums-TDPR 6. You must complete at least one practicum at UCSD. It\u2019s recommended you complete TDPR 6 within a year of declaring a Theatre major."
