For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Special Advising Note:While not all lower division courses in this major are required for transfer major preparation, the Scripps Department encourages transfer students to complete as much of the major\u2019s lower division coursework as possible prior to transferring to UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation.The UC San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography offers a Geosciences major leading to a B.S. degree, with emphasis on the quantitative aspects of the field. As a guiding concept, the focus of the Geosciences curriculum is the physical and chemical evolution of the earth system and the energetics and dynamics of this evolution.
