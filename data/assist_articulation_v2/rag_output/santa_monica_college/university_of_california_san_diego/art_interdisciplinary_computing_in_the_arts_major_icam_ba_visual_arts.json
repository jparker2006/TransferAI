      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as soon as possible for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. Students who wish to emphasize Music in their upper-division coursework at UCSD will declare their major through the Music Department; students who wish to emphasize Visual Arts in their upper-division coursework at UCSD will declare their major through the Visual Arts Department. Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts major draws upon ideas and concepts from computer science, art and cultural theory. The program is unique among currently existing computer art or design programs which, on the one hand, usually focus on the use of computers for particular media and, on the other hand, do not enter into a serious dialogue with current research in computer science, only teaching the students off-the-shelf software. Our program aims to train a new type of artist, who is familiar with art and media history, who is equally proficient with computer programming and artistic skills, who is always ready to learn new technologies, and who is comfortable interacting with scientists and computer industry resources. We aim to prepare students to move between the worlds of computer science and technology, the arts, and the culture at large by being equally proficient with computing and cultural concepts. Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts majors may continue with more specialized studies on a graduate level, seek professional careers in digital media, or develop as independent artists.
