      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep General Advice: Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to the Bioengineering: Biotechnology major at UC San Diego.Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)Differential Equations (Math. 20D)Complete calculus-based physics series with lab experience (Physics 2A and 2B with 2CL)Chemistry 6A and 6B Note: An equivalent to UCSD's Chem 7L laboratory courses are strongly recommended for students applying to all majors offered by the Department of Bioengineering.Application for Admission to the Bioengineering: Biotechnology major: Since fall 2004, applicants seeking admission as transfer students are considered for direct admission into the Bioengineering: Biotechnology major. The only way to become a Bioengineering: Biotechnology major is to be directly admitted from community college as an entering transfer student. Although the actual GPA cutoff depends on the number of openings, at least a 3.2 GPA in the community college transfer courses and a 3.4 GPA in the above screening courses, are needed to gain admission.Prospective transfer students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere (at institutions not appearing on ASSIST), may request to have transfer credit applied toward the department's major requirements by submitting an \"Undergraduate Student Petition\" together with a transcript and catalog course description from the institution where the course(s) were taken. These documents are reviewed for approval by the relevant UCSD department and the Bioengineering Undergraduate Studies Committee. \"Undergraduate Student Petitions\" are available online at http://students.ucsd.edu/my-tritonlink/forms/index.html and in the Student Affairs Office. This degree is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).Recommended Preparation:In addition to the screening courses, transfer students are advised to take equivalents for as many of the following recommended preparation courses as possible:\u25cf BILD 1 The Cell\u25cf BILD 3 Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. This course is not required but must also be taken as a prerequisite for BICD 100.\u25cf CHEM 6C General Chemistry III\u25cf CHEM 7L General Chemistry Laboratory\u25cf CHEM 41A/B Organic Chemistry for Life Sciences I/II\u25cf MAE 8 Matlab Programming for Engineering Analysis\u25cf MATH 18 Linear Algebra\u25cf MATH 20E Vector Calculus\u25cf PHYS 2C Physics Fluids, Waves, Thermodynamics, and Optics Entering credit for the recommended preparation courses will affect enrollment in the following courses: \u25cf BENG 100 Introduction to Probability and Statistics. Prerequisites include Math 18. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year \u2013 or in Summer Session if offered.\u25cf BENG 123 Dynamic Simulation in Bioengineering. Prerequisites include MATH 18 and CHEM 41AB. Transfer students are recommended to take this course Winter Quarter of Senior Year.\u25cf BENG 130 Biotechnology Thermodynamics and Kinetics. Prerequisites include PHYS 2C. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Winter Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf BENG 166A Cell and Tissue Engineering. Prerequisites include BILD 1, CHEM 6C, and PHYS 2C. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf BENG 168 Biomolecular Engineering. Prerequisites include BILD 1. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Winter Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf BICD 100 Genetics. Prerequisites are BILD 1 and BILD 3. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Winter Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf CENG 101A Introductory Fluid Mechanics. Prerequisites include MATH 20E. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf MAE 170 Experimental Techniques. Prerequisites include PHYS 2C and PHYS 2CL. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year. Please note that time to degree is affected by entering credit for lower division STEM courses.
