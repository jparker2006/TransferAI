      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2022, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Special Advising Note:While not all lower division courses in this major are required for transfer major preparation, the Environmental Systems Program encourages transfer students to complete as much of the major\u2019s lower division coursework as possible prior to transferring to UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation.The UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography Undergraduate Department offers an oceanic and atmospheric sciences major leading to a B.S. degree, with emphasis on the quantitative aspects of the field. As a guiding concept, the oceanic and atmospheric sciences curriculum focuses on the physics and chemistry governing the ocean and atmosphere. The major engages students in a wide range of topics of scientific interest and increasing social concern including ocean waves, tides and circulation, natural climate variability including El Ni\u00f1o, human-caused climate change, global warming, ocean acidification, atmospheric storms, and oceanic eddies.
