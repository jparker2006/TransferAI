      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as soon as possible for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. Cognitive science is a diverse field which is unified and motivated by a single basic inquiry: What is cognition? How do people, animals, or computers 'think', act, and learn? In order to understand the mind/brain, cognitive science brings together methods and discoveries from neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and computer science. UCSD has been at the forefront of this exciting field and our Cognitive Science Department was the first of its kind in the world. It is part of an exceptional scientific community and remains a dominant influence in the field it helped create. In addition to preparing undergraduates for careers in a variety of sciences, the major also provides an excellent background for many professional fields, including medicine, clinical psychology, and information technology. Students must choose one of the following Math sequences: Math 10ABC and 18 or Math 20AB and 18. For more information, please visit http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/index.html"
