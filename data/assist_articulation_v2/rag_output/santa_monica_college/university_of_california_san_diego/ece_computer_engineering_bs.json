For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrepGeneral Advice: Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to Computer Engineering.- Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)- Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)- Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)- Differential Equations (Math. 20D)- Linear Algebra (Math. 18)- Complete calculus-based physics series (Physics 2A-B-C)- CSE 8B or 11 and, CSE 12 and, CSE 20Note about ECE 15 and ECE 35 credit: If students take a C programming course or circuits course at a non-UC College without an official articulation, they must pass the ECE 15 or 35 Waiver Exam to receive transfer credit for UCSD ECE 15 or 35. These are NOT placement tests. For more information, go to http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/ece-15-35-waiver-examsFor more information please visit http://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/transfer-studentsNOTE: Articulation of engineering coursework will be subject to thorough review and evaluation."
