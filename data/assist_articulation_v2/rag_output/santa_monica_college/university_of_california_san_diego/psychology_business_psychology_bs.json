PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.For more details, please visit our main website: http://psychology.ucsd.edu/ and specific information for New and Prospective Students.Special Advising Notes:All majors within the Psychology Department must complete listed lower division major course requirements, regardless of IGETC certification.Lower-division courses cannot be petitioned for upper-division major course requirements. All Community College courses are considered lower-division.For the Natural Science courses, students are required to complete a total of any three lower-division natural science courses from the list below. * Please note: only one of BILD 12, COGS 17 or PSYC 2 may be counted towards this requirement.For the Formal Skills courses, students are required to complete a total of three lower-division formal skills courses in research methods and calculus. Only one research methods course can be applied to the formal skills area.For careers that require advanced calculus, we recommend students complete MATH 20A and MATH 20B.For students pursuing future graduate study, we recommend COGS 18, CSE 11, ECE 15, or MAE 8."
