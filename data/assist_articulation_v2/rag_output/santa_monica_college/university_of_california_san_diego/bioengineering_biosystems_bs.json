      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep General Advice: Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to the Bioengineering: BioSystems major at UC San Diego.Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)Differential Equations (Math. 20D)Calculus-based physics series (Physics 2A and 2B)Chemistry 6A and 6BAdmission Requirements:Prospective transfer students are able to apply for \"direct admission\" into the Bioengineering: BioSystems major by indicating their choice on the Undergraduate Admissions Application. Effective Fall 2015, the only way to become a Bioengineering: BioSystems major is to be directly admitted from community college as an entering transfer student. Although the actual GPA cutoff depends on the number of openings, at least a 3.2 GPA in the community college transfer courses and a 3.4 GPA in the above screening courses are needed to gain admission.Prospective transfer students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere (at institutions not appearing on ASSIST), may request to have transfer credit applied toward the department's major requirements by submitting an \"Undergraduate Student Petition\" together with a transcript and catalog course description from the institution where the course(s) were taken. These documents are reviewed for approval by the relevant UCSD department and the Bioengineering Undergraduate Studies Committee. \"Undergraduate Student Petitions\" are available online at http://students.ucsd.edu/my-tritonlink/forms/index.html and in the Student Affairs Office. This degree is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).Recommended Preparation Courses:In addition to the screening courses, transfer students are advised to take equivalents for as many of the following recommended preparation courses as possible:\u25cf BILD 1 The Cell. This course is not required, but see below.\u25cf MAE 8 MATLAB. Programming for Engineering Analysis or BENG 2 Introductory Computer Programming and MATLAB. We take credit for either.\u25cf MATH 18 Linear Algebra\u25cf MATH 20E Vector Calculus\u25cf PHYS 2BL Physics Laboratory \u2013 Mechanics\u25cf PHYS 2C Physics\u2014Fluids, Waves, Thermodynamics, and OpticsEntering credit for the recommended preparation courses will affect enrollment in the following courses:\u25cf BENG 100 Introduction to Probability and Statistics. Prerequisites include Math 18. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Spring Quarter of Junior Year \u2013 or in Summer Session if offered. \u25cf BENG 110. Musculoskeletal Biomechanics. Prerequisites include MATH 18, MATH 20E, PHYS 2BL and PHYS 2C. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf BENG 140A/B. Bioengineering Physiology. Prerequisites include BILD 1. Transfer students should take these courses in Winter Quarter and Spring Quarter of Senior Year. BENG 120 and BENG 102 are prerequisites; however, if BENG 140A and BENG 140B are taken early (some take them Junior Year), BILD 1 will be a satisfactory prerequisite. \u25cf ECE 35 Linear Circuits. Prerequisites include MATH 18. This course is a critical prerequisite for BENG 152 and BENG 186B. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year, otherwise key courses will be delayed by a year.Please note that time to degree is affected by credit for lower division STEM courses.Please consult the BS Bioengineering:Biosystems curriculum and flowchart at https://bioengineering.ucsd.edu/undergrad/programs/biosysFor additional information, please see the Bioengineering Department's Undergraduate Program website at http://be.ucsd.edu/undergrad"
