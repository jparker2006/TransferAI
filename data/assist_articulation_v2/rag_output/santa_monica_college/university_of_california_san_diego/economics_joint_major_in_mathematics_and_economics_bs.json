      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Special Advising Note: Transfer students must complete linear algebra (Math 18), lower division calculus (Math 20A, B, and C) and lower division microeconomics and macroeconomics (Econ 1 and 3) for admission to the major. In addition, students are strongly advised to complete differential equations (Math 20D) before enrolling at UC San Diego. Having this class completed will help students move more efficiently toward graduation. This major is considered to be excellent preparation for Ph.D. study in economics and business administration, as well as for graduate studies for professional management degrees, including the MBA. Majors in economics generally recognize the importance of mathematics to their discipline. Undergraduate students who plan to pursue doctoral studies in economics and business need the more advanced mathematics training prescribed in this major. Majors in mathematics often feel the need for more formal introduction to issues involving business applications of science and mathematics. Extending their studies into economics provides this application and can provide a bridge to successful careers or advanced study. This major provides a more formal framework making it easier to combine study in economics and mathematics.
