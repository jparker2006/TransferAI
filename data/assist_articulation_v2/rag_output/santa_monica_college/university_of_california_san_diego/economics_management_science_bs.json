      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Special Advising Note: Transfer students must complete lower division economics courses (Microeconomics &amp; Macroeconomics) as well as the calculus classes Math 20A, B to be admitted to the major. Students are strongly advised to complete Math 20C because students are not able to begin their upper division core courses until Math 20C is completed. Students are also advised to complete financial accounting (Econ 4). Having Math 20C in particular and Econ 4 completed will help students move more efficiently toward graduation. The Management Science major builds on a set of related quantitative methods commonly used to solve problems arising in the private (business and finance) and public (government) sectors. The major introduces students to the structure of these techniques and their application in both private and public enterprise. While Management Science majors will gain some familiarity with the traditional functional fields of business management, this program is more tightly focused and more quantitative than a traditional business administration major. It is not, however, a program in applied mathematics or operations research, since the economic interpretation and application of the tools are continually stressed. Rather, it is a quantitative major in applied economics with a management focus. For more information please visit https://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/index.html"
