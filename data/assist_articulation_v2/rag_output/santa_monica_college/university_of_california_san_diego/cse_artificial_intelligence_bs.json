      "text": "Effective Fall 2025, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrepThe educational philosophy behind the AI major has three components: (1) Help students develop foundations that will serve them a lifetime, so they can build the next advances in AI systems. (2) Provide students with opportunities to learn AI in many different settings and with many applications \u2013 we will engage with many units on campus so students have the option to connect across as many fields as possible. (3) Situate the area of AI in a broader societal, ethical, and professional context so students are empowered to reason about the impact of their work.Course equivalency: For course equivalencies not listed below, visit the CSE Student Affairs Office, CSE Building (EBU3B, Room 1200) first floor, or email CSEStudent@eng.ucsd.edu.For information not found here, please visit the CSE Undergraduate Program at: https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate"
