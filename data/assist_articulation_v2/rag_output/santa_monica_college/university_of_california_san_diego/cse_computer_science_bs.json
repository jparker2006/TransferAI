      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.Effective Fall 2018, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrepEffective Fall 2015, the B.S. and B.A. in Computer Science, the B.S. in Computer Engineering, and the B.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in Bioinformatics are impacted for transfer students. Visit cse.ucsd.edu for full information.General advice: Transfer students are advised to complete the following courses for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation.- Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)- Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)- Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)- Linear Algebra (Math. 18)- Two courses chosen from: PHYS 2A or PHYS 4A, PHYS 2B or PHYS 4B, CHEM 6A or CHEM 6AH, CHEM 6B or CHEM 6BH, BILD 1, BILD 2, BILD 3- Highest level of introductory computer programming language course offered at the community college. For example, CSE 3, CSE 6R, and 8A may be used to fulfill the lower-division elective requirement; CSE 8B or 11 fulfill other lower-division requirements.Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design (CSE 12)Discrete Mathematics (CSE 20)Course equivalency: For course equivalencies not listed below, visit the CSE Student Affairs Office, CSE Building (EBU3B, Room 1200) first floor, or email CSEStudent@eng.ucsd.edu.For information not found here, please visit the CSE Undergraduate Program at: https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate"
