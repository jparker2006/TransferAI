      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, transfer major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep. Please also refer to http://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/admission/transfer-major-prep.html for additional information. The courses listed below reflect requirements for transfer major preparation for admission consideration, as well as lower-division courses required for the major that may be completed at the community college.Special Advising Notes:**CHEM 7L is not required for Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution, but is required for transfer major preparation/admission consideration. **CHEM 41A and 41B are not required for Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution but they are prerequisites for many upper-division Biology courses. EBE students whose graduate education or career requires biochemistry course work should take Organic Chemistry in preparation for Biochemistry. ** While not all lower division major requirements are required for transfer major preparation, the School of Biological Sciences encourages transfer students to complete all of the lower-division course work required for their desired biology major prior to transfer.**Additionally, students are highly encouraged to complete any sequence (Biology, Math, Physics, General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry) at the institution in which it is begun to allow for continuity in course material.**The articulated community college course(s) listed below have been approved to satisfy the respective UCSD course(s), however the content covered in the community college course(s) may not be identical to the content covered in the UCSD course(s). Any required major course that does not have an articulation will need to be taken at UCSD.**All courses required and used for the biology major must be completed with a letter grade of C- or better. This policy applies to all lower-division, upper-division, and required courses taken in other departments, as well as courses transferred and used toward major requirements.**Equivalency for BILD 1, 2, 3 and 4 is granted based on completion of the major\u2019s Biology course sequence at the community college (as listed below), not on individual community college course completion. No partial credit will be granted.**Agreements listed below are academic-year specific.For more information visit www.biology.ucsd.edu."
