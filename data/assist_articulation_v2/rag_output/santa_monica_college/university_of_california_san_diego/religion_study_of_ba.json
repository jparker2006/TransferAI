      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Study of Religion: The interdisciplinary major in the Study of Religion is designed to develop fundamental skills in critical thinking, comparative analysis, research, and written expression. As such, the B.A. degree is appropriate for careers in education, government, business and non-profit agencies, as well as being an excellent preparation for graduate study in a variety of fields and disciplines. At UC San Diego, faculty from the departments of Anthropology, Communication, Ethnic Studies, History, Jewish Studies, Literature, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology, and Visual Arts aim at fostering a student's understanding of religion as one of the primary expressions of the human condition and as an historically powerful force in the shaping of human cultures. The goal is to use the study of religion in order to develop critical thinking and a more adequate understanding of history and society. Courses for the major typically investigate one or more religious traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism, as well as smaller, local and transnational traditions from around the globe. Such courses explore religions in terms of their literatures, rituals, symbols, myths, histories, doctrines, art, or politics. The program also offers courses that make a critical inquiry into the category of \"religion\" itself. The major consists of 12 upper-division courses. Lower division coursework is highly recommended but is not required. Lower division preparation should be wide and varied (for example, introductory courses pertaining to culture, sociology, philosophy, humanities, early civilizations, and classics). Courses in which religion figures prominently, as well as courses that employ the analytical tools and conceptual categories of the human sciences, would be useful in preparing the student for the major. The program does not have a foreign language requirement, and foreign language courses cannot be used for the major. However, the program strongly encourages foreign language study (for the ability to read the languages of original sources)for students who may pursue graduate study. More information about the program and major is available on the Study of Religion website: religion.ucsd.edu."
