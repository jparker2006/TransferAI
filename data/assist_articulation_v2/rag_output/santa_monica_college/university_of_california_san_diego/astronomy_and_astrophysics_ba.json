      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. The Bachelor of Arts in Astronomy and Astrophysics is intended to give students a detailed background in the full landscape of astronomy and astrophysics while also offering students breadth by requiring courses in other related disciplines. Students take upper division courses on topics such as stars, planets, galaxies and cosmology, and then select from a wide range of courses in math, physics, geophysics, engineering, chemistry, or biology to complete their major study. The intention of the major is to serve students interested in careers in science communication, science outreach, science policy, teaching in the sciences at the K-12 level, or a variety of positions in industry."
