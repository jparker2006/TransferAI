      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep General Advice: Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to the Bioengineering: Bioinformatics major at UC San Diego.Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)Differential Equations (Math. 20D)Calculus-based physics series (Physics 2Aand 2B)Chemistry 6A and 6B Note: An equivalent to UCSD's Chem 7L laboratory course is strongly recommended for students applying to all majors offered by the Department of Bioengineering although it is not considered for screening purposes.Admission Requirements:Prospective transfer students are able to apply for \"direct admission\" into the Bioengineering: Bioinformatics major by indicating their choice on the Undergraduate Admissions Application. Effective Fall 2015, the only way to become a Bioengineering: Bioinformatics major is to be directly admitted from community college as an entering transfer student. Although the actual GPA cutoff depends on the number of openings, at least a 3.2 GPA in the community college transfer courses and a 3.4 GPA in the above screening courses are needed to gain admission.Prospective transfer students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere (at institutions not appearing on ASSIST), may request to have transfer credit applied toward the department's major requirements by submitting an \"Undergraduate Student Petition\" together with a transcript and catalog course description from the institution where the course(s) were taken. These documents are reviewed for approval by the relevant UCSD department and the Bioengineering Undergraduate Studies Committee. \"Undergraduate Student Petitions\" are available online at http://students.ucsd.edu/my-tritonlink/forms/index.html and in the Student Affairs Office. This degree is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).Recommended Preparation Courses:In addition to the screening courses, transfer students are advised to take equivalents for as many of the following recommended preparation courses as possible:\u25cf BILD 1 The Cell\u25cf BILD 3 Organismic and Evolutionary Biology\u25cf BILD 4 Introductory Biology Lab\u25cf CSE 11 Introduction to Programming and Computational Problem-Solving: Accelerated Pace\u25cf CSE 12 Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design\u25cf MATH 18 Linear Algebra\u25cf MATH 20E Vector CalculusEntering credit for the recommended preparation courses will affect enrollment in the following courses:\u25cf BENG 100 Introduction to Probability and Statistics. Prerequisites include Math 18. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year \u2013 or in Summer Session if offered. \u25cf CSE 21 Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year, as it is a prerequisite for CSE 100. \u25cf CSE 100 Advanced Data Structures. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Winter Quarter of Junior Year. Prerequisites include CSE 12 and CSE 21\u25cf CSE 185 Advanced Bioinformatics Laboratory. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Spring Quarter of Junior Year. Prerequisites include CSE 11, CSE 12, and BILD 1 and BILD 4.Please note that time to degree is affected by credit for lower division STEM courses.Please consult the BS Bioengineering:Bioinformatics curriculum and flowchart at https://bioengineering.ucsd.edu/undergrad/programs/bioinfoFor additional information, please see the Bioengineering Department's Undergraduate Program website at http://be.ucsd.edu/undergrad"
