      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience is a joint major between the Department of Cognitive Science and the Department of Psychology. Students may choose to be advised by either department. Cognitive science is a diverse field which is unified and motivated by a single basic inquiry: What is cognition? How do people, animals, or computers 'think', act, and learn? In order to understand the mind/brain, cognitive science brings together methods and discoveries from neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and computer science. UCSD has been at the forefront of this exciting field and our Cognitive Science Department was the first of its kind in the world. It is part of an exceptional scientific community and remains a dominant influence in the field it helped create. In addition to preparing undergraduates for careers in a variety of sciences, the major also provides an excellent background for many professional fields, including medicine, clinical psychology, and information technology. For more details, please visit our main website at http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/ and undergraduate program at http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/index.html Special Advising Notes: Transfer students seeking to major in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as early as possible before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. Students can petition for courses not articulated to count at an equivalent academic level ONLY for the Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience Major, meaning that a lower-division course can ONLY be petitioned to count towards a lower-division major requirement. Lower-division courses cannot be petitioned for upper-division major requirements. All Community College courses are considered lower-division. It is highly recommended that students choose their courses from those listed below. Students who plan to pursue graduate study and/or research in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience or a related field are advised to select a course equivalent to UC San Diego\u2019s COGS 18 or CSE 7. These preferred courses are critical to future success."
