      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. This major is designed for students who wish to pursue the study of a particular language from a variety of perspectives. To this end, students will take courses in linguistics and literature, as well as electives in linguistics, literature, and cultural studies. It provides preparation for a wide variety of careers that make use of second language skills. Language Studies majors must consult the faculty adviser in the Department of Linguistics to have approved an individual curricular plan to satisfy the major requirements. Linguistics 101 is required as an introduction to the field and serves as the prerequisite to certain other courses. Students who choose a linguistics major should enroll in it as early as possible. Each linguistics degree requires a certain level of language proficiency. Students are encouraged to take as many courses in language as possible to prepare for the major requirements at UC San Diego. To review the Linguistics Department degree requirements, visit the UCSD General Catalog web site at http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog , click on Course Listings, then Linguistics. There you will find a description of the department, degree requirements for undergraduate (and graduate) degrees, and course listings.
