      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrepGeneral Advice: Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to the Bioengineering major at UC San Diego::Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)Differential Equations (Math. 20D)Calculus-based physics series with lab experience (Physics 2A-B with Physics 2BL and 2CL)Chemistry 6A and 6B Note: An equivalent to UCSD's Chem 7L laboratory courses is strongly recommended for students applying to all majors offered by the Department of Bioengineering although it is not considered for screening purposes.Application for Admission to the Bioengineering Major: Since Fall 2004, applicants seeking admission as transfer students are considered for direct admission into the Bioengineering major. The only way to become a Bioengineering major is to be directly admitted from community college as an entering transfer student. Although the actual GPA cutoff depends on the number of openings, at least a 3.2 GPA in the community college transfer courses and a 3.4 GPA in the above screening courses, are needed to gain admission. Prospective transfer students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere (at institutions not appearing on ASSIST), may request to have transfer credit applied toward the department's major requirements by submitting an \"Undergraduate Student Petition\" together with a transcript and catalog course description from the institution where the course(s) were taken. These documents are reviewed for approval by the relevant UCSD department and the Bioengineering Undergraduate Studies Committee. \"Undergraduate Student Petitions\" are available online at http://students.ucsd.edu/my-tritonlink/forms/index.html and in the Student Affairs Office. This degree is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).Recommended Preparation Courses:In addition to the screening courses, transfer students are advised to take equivalents for as many of the following recommended preparation courses as possible:\u25cf BILD 1 The Cell\u25cf MAE 8 Matlab Programming for Engineering Analysis\u25cf MATH 18 Linear Algebra\u25cf MATH 20E Vector Calculus\u25cf PHYS 2C Physics\u2014Fluids, Waves, Thermodynamics, and Optics\u25cf CHEM 7L General Chemistry Laboratory. Entering credit for the recommended preparation courses will affect enrollment in the following courses:\u25cf BENG 100. Introduction to Probability and Statistics. Prerequisites include Math 18. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year \u2013 or in Summer if offered.\u25cf BENG 110. Musculoskeletal Biomechanics. Prerequisites include MATH 18 and MATH 20E. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf BENG 130. Biotechnology Thermodynamics and Kinetics. Prerequisites include PHYS 2C. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Winter Quarter of Senior Year.\u25cf BENG 140A/B. Bioengineering Physiology. Prerequisites include BILD 1. Transfer students are recommended to take these courses in Winter Quarter and Spring Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf MAE 40. Linear Circuits. Prerequisites include MATH 18. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year.\u25cf MAE 107. Computational Methods in Engineering. Prerequisites include MATH 18 and MAE 8. Transfer students are recommended to take this course in Fall Quarter of Junior Year. Please note that time to degree is affected by credit for lower division STEM courses. Please consult the BS Bioengineering curriculum and flowchart at https://bioengineering.ucsd.edu/undergrad/programs/bioeng For additional information, please see the Bioengineering Department's Undergraduate Program website at http://be.ucsd.edu/undergrad"
