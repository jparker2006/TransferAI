      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2022, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Special Advising Note: While not all lower division courses in this major are required for transfer major preparation, the Environmental Systems Program encourages transfer students to complete as much of the major\u2019s lower division coursework as possible prior to transferring to UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. To encourage and foster an interdisciplinary focus in the major, the Environmental Systems program is supported by a wide range of UCSD faculty representing the natural sciences, the social sciences, the humanities, engineering, and medicine. The program includes a required lower-division core, an upper-division \"integrating course sequence\", two other upper division courses, an advanced track, and a senior integrative project and seminar. For more information see the Environmental Systems web page at http://esys.ucsd.edu."
