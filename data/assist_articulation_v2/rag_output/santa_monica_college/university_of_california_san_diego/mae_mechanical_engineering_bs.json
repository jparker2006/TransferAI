      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrepAs of Fall 2014, the BS degrees in Mechanical, Aerospace Engineering are capped. Because of heavy student interest in these two majors, and the limited resources available to accommodate this demand, maintenance of a high-quality program makes it necessary to limit enrollment.Students must apply to be admitted directly into the Mechanical Engineering Major at UC San Diego. To be considered for admission to the Mechanical Engineering major, transfer students must have completed the following courses:- Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)- Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)- Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)- Differential Equations (Math. 20D)- Linear Algebra (Math. 18)- Calculus-based physics series with lab experience (Physics 2A-B-C)- Chemistry 6A*We recommend that students take MAE 8 (MATLAB Programming for Engineering Analysis), MAE 20 (Elements of Materials Science) and MAE 40 (Linear Circuits) as these courses are a requirement for UC San Diego students majoring in Mechanical Engineering. In addition to the required courses above, it is recommended that transfers complete Vector Calculus (Math. 20E) and a MATLAB programming course, if available.Courses that have not been articulated and do not show an equivalent transfer course on ASSIST.org must be approved via petition on an individual basis by the MAE Department. Please refer to the MAE Department\u2019s Undergraduate Program website for more information: https://mae.ucsd.edu/transfer-equivalencies.Mechanical Engineering is a four-year ABET-accredited curriculum covering statics and dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid flow, heat transfer, materials, controls, and mechanical design. Mechanical engineers can do almost anything under the sun. Our graduates work in healthcare, biotech, aerospace, automotive, robotics, environment, energy, and many other industries."
