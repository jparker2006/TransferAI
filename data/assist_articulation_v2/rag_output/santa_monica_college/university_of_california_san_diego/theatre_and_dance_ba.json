      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. \ufeffThe double major in Theatre and Dance provides students with a solid academic base and an artistic base in both theatre and dance disciplines. Furthermore, requirements for this double major will create stronger and more experienced directors (for their exposure to choreography), choreographers (for their exposure to directing), actors (for the poise and strength they will attain from dance, and dancers (for having confronted text and character). Students should meet with the department's undergraduate coordinator as soon as practical (but no later than the quarter in which they declare the major) in order to plan an appropriate individual course of study. Double majors should complete the Petition for Double Major form obtained from their college and submit it to the department for review and approval.
