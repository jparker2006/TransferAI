      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. \ufeffThe Bachelor of Science in Astronomy and Astrophysics offers students an in-depth course of study in the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of modern astrophysical science. The upper division sequence of core physics material is complemented by elective courses in topical areas such as stars, galaxies, planets and cosmology. Multiple laboratory courses provide the students with the practical skills to make a smooth transition into advanced research work in astronomy and astrophysics. This major is intended to prepare interested students for graduate study, but also serves students interested in careers in multiple industries."
