      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Effective Fall 2015, admission to all of the engineering majors at UC San Diego will be limited, as the majors have been declared capped. Students must apply to be directly admitted to the NanoEngineering major. Transfer students must have completed the following required courses in order to be considered for admission to the NanoEngineering major: \u2022 Calculus I - for Science and Engineering (Math 20A) \u2022 Calculus II - for Science and Engineering (Math 20B) \u2022 Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math 20C) \u2022 Differential Equations (Math 20D) \u2022 Calculus-based physics series (Physics 2AB) \u2022 General Chemistry (Chemistry 6ABC) Special Advising Note: Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. Transfer students may complete the B.S. in NanoEngineering in three years, if students have completed the required courses above, in addition to the following highly recommended courses: \u2022 Linear Algebra (Math 18, formerly 20F) \u2022 Calculus-based physics series(Physics 2CD) \u2022 General Chemistry Lab (Chemistry 7L) NanoEngineering is an ABET-accredited four-year curriculum which encompasses studies in nanoscale science, engineering and technology that have the potential to make valuable advances in various areas, such as new materials, biology and medicine; energy conversion; sensors; and environmental remediation. Nanoengineering is a highly diversified and multidisciplinary field. For more information please visit http://nanoengineering.ucsd.edu"
