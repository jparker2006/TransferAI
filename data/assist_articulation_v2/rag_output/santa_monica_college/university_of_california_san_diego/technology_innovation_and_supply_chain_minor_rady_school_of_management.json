      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as soon as possible for their minor before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the minor helps students move efficiently toward graduation. Rady\u2019s Technology, Innovation &amp; Supply Chain Minor combines theoretical concepts and practical skills that allow students to focus on value creation, managing relationships with diverse people in diverse functions, industries, global locations, and leveraging technology and data analytics to create the best supply chains. Supply Chain also spans to virtually every industry, not only including manufacturing and distribution-based industries, but also industries such as Banking which require Supply Chain skills for planning, supplier sourcing and management, process design, information flow management, procurement, and cash management. Supply Chain consulting is a huge and growing business. Globalization, technology, and changing customer expectations push the profession to seek people who can pioneer the intersections of the supply chain with the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, the cloud, and data security. The minor consists of twenty-eight total units that span the various key fundamentals of the industry. All courses applied toward the Technology, Innovation and Supply Chain minor must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better). MGT 4 Financial Accounting is cross-listed with ECON 4. Either will satisfy the Technology, Innovation, and Supply Chain minor requirement. Courses that may be equivalent to MGT/ECON 4, and are not on ASSIST must be petitioned for credit with the Economics Department. Courses that may be equivalent to MGT 5, and are not on ASSIST must be petitioned for credit with the Rady School of Management. Information about the Technology, Innovation and Supply Chain minor is also available at our web site: https://rady.ucsd.edu/programs/undergraduate-programs/supply-chain-minor/ Of the seven (7) total courses are required for the minor, five (5) must be upper-division.
