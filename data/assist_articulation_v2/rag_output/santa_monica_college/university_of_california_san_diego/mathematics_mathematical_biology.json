For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep This major is designed to provide a sound grounding in a core set of mathematical, statistical, and computational subjects relevant in solving bioscience and bioengineering problems.NOTE: Students who have taken a vector calculus course at a non-UC college must successfully petition the course for 20E equivalency. Petitions must generally include course syllabus, textbook information and final exam. More information on the petition process for 20E can be found at the following site: https://www.math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/math-20e-equivalency"
