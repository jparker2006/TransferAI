      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Effective Fall 2018, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Effective Fall 2015, the B.S. and B.A. in Computer Science, the B.S. in Computer Engineering, and the B.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in Bioinformatics are impacted for transfer students. Visit cse.ucsd.edu for full information. General advice: Transfer students are advised to complete the following courses for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation.- Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A) - Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B) - Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C) - Differential Equations (Math. 20D) - Linear Algebra (Math. 18) - Mechanics (Physics 2A) - Electricity and Magnetism (Physics 2B) - Fluids, Waves, Thermodynamics, and Optics (Physics 2C) - Highest level of introductory computer programming language course offered at the community college. For example, CSE 3, CSE 6R and 8A may be used to fulfill the lower-division elective requirement; CSE 8B or 11 fulfill other lower-division requirements. Course equivalency: For course equivalencies not listed below, visit the CSE Student Affairs Office, CSE Building (EBU3B, Room 1200) first floor, or email CSEStudent@eng.ucsd.edu.
