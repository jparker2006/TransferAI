      "text": "DATED MATERIAL SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT THE CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Special Advising Note: Transfer students are strongly advised to complete as many preparatory courses as soon as possible for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. Why International Studies? The International Studies Program (ISP) at UC San Diego offers an interdisciplinary major that brings the insights of different disciplines\u2014anthropology, economics, international business, history, linguistics, literature, philosophy, political science and sociology\u2014to the deep exploration of the causes and consequences of the processes found across the globe. The major provides students with both a firm grounding in a discipline and the flexibility to permit exploration from alternative perspectives. For more information, please visit http://isp.ucsd.edu. In addition to the BA in International Studies, ISP and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) offer a sequential Bachelor of Arts / Master of International Affairs program. With careful preparation, transfer students are able to complete their BA in International Studies and then their Master of International Affairs in three years following transfer to UCSD.
