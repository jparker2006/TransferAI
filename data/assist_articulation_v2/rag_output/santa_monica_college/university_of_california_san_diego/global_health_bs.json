      "text": "DATED MATERIAL, SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PLEASE CONSULT CURRENT UCSD GENERAL CATALOG FOR ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Global Health is a dynamic and relatively new field addressing an urgent social concern, as well as a powerful interdisciplinary intellectual synthesis aimed at understanding and productively intervening in the many processes of illness and healing across the globe. The Global Health majors are designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of factors related to illness, health, and healing from a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective that transcends national borders and regional interests, and takes cultural difference and cross-cultural diversity fully into account. The Global Health majors will prepare students to pursue advanced degrees and careers in 1) medicine, dentistry, and nursing; 2) medical social sciences and medical humanities; 3) public and private sector service provision, including NGOs, government and international institutions and philanthropies; 4) international health, public health, and epidemiology. All courses applied to the major must receive a letter grade of C- or better. The Global Health majors have no pre-requisite courses for entry, students may take all courses at UC San Diego or they may complete lower division coursework outlined below, prior to entry.
