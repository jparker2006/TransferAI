      "answer": "Students will be placed on academic probation when: they have attempted 12 or more semester units at SMC and their SMC cumulative grade point average is below a 2.0 as noted on their SMC transcript; or transfer to SMC while on disqualification status at another college or university; or are readmitted after disqualification from SMC. they have attempted 12 or more semester units at SMC and their SMC cumulative grade point average is below a 2.0 as noted on their SMC transcript; or transfer to SMC while on disqualification status at another college or university; or are readmitted after disqualification from SMC. Students who have been on academic probation for two semesters or more will be subject to lower enrollment priority and may lose the California College Promise Grant. Probationary students are limited to a 9 unit* enrollment maximum in a Spring or Fall semester and 5 units in a Winter or Summer session until academic probation is removed. You will continue on academic probation until you raise your SMC cumulative grade point average to a 2.0 or better. To avoid a probationary status, avoid D's and F's in your classes, and if you must drop classes, drop them by the withdrawal deadline posted in your corsair portal to avoid receiving an ‘F’. If you are already on academic probation, one way to return to good standing is to repeat courses required for your academic goal/s in which you received D's or F's. To discuss other strategies for removal from academic probation, speak to an SMC Counselor. *F-1 visa students are required by federal law to complete 12 units in each fall and spring semester regardless of academic status. Progress Probation A student enrolled in at least 12 semester units at SMC will be placed on progress probation if the percentage of units in which the student receives the notation of \"W” (Withdrawal), \"I\" (Incomplete) or \"NP\" (No Pass) reaches or exceeds: 50% of units enrolled, after enrolling in 12 or more units as noted on their SMC transcript. 50% of units enrolled, after enrolling in 12 or more units as noted on their SMC transcript. To avoid progress probation, try to avoid earning ‘NP’ or ‘I’ grades, and if you must drop classes, drop them by the stated deadline posted in your corsair portal to avoid a ‘W’ notation. Drop deadlines are listed next to each class in your Corsair Connect portal. If you are already on progress probation, one way to return to good standing is to repeat those required courses for your academic goal/s in which you received a ‘W’ or ‘NP’. To discuss other strategies for removal from progress probation, speak to an SMC Counselor. Students who have been on progress probation for two semesters or more will be subject to lower enrollment priority and may lose the California College Promise Grant. Probationary students are limited to a 9 unit* enrollment maximum in a Spring or Fall semester and a 5 unit maximum in a Winter or Summer session until progress probation is removed. If you again complete less than the required percentage of units in the semester after you are placed on Progress Probation, you will become disqualified. *F-1 visa students are required by federal law to complete 12 units in each fall and spring semester regardless of probationary status",

      "answer": "Pass/no pass is a good option if you want to take a class, but don't want the grade to impact your grade point average. If you received a \"C\" grade or higher in the class, the grade will appear as a \"P\" (for \"pass\") on your SMC transcript, and you will also receive the units for that course. If you received a \"D\" or an \"F\" in the class, however, a \"NP\" (for \"no pass\") will appear on your transcript, and you will not receive the units for that course. In either case, the course will not impact your grade point average. Starting Spring 2022: The deadline to opt-in for pass/no pass grading will be the last day of instruction for the class. See your Corsair Connect for the specific date for each class you are enrolled in. Please speak with a counselor if you have any questions. The \"No Pass\" (NP) grade will be excluded from progress probation and progress disqualification calculation. This provision (per CCCCO Executive Order 2022-02) applies to winter 2022, spring 2022, summer 2022, and fall 2022. Generally speaking, you should not take any of the following classes for Pass/No Pass: English 1; English 2; any major transferable math class; any course that meets the CSU GE Area A1, A2, A3 and B4 and IGETC Area 1A, 1B, 1C and 2; and any major transfer requirements. Colleges and universities have a limit on the number of units that can be taken on a Pass /No Pass basis. To find out unit limits for various colleges and universities, please speak with a counselor. In addition, if you are planning on attending law school or medical school in the future, please refer to specific law school and medical school webpage for information on how courses taken on a Pass/No Pass basis may impact your admission.",

To locate a catalog online refer to www.collegesource.org. If you are requesting an evaluation of English composition courses, be prepared to bring a copy of the course syllabus too. If you do not have the syllabus, contact the department at the institution where the course was completed to obtain a copy. It is the student's responsibility to have official transcripts, from all institutions attended, sent directly to the SMC admissions office. Contact Online Counseling to see if an online evaluation of transcripts and AP test scores is possible. SMC counseling offers a preliminary unofficial transcript/exam score evaluation service for the AA GE, IGETC and/or CSU GE patterns.",

      "answer": "You may repeat a class in which you received a “W”, \"D\", \"F\", or \"NC/NP\" one time without counselor authorization. Please note that a student who is currently enrolled in a course will not be able to re-enroll in that same course for a subsequent term until the student receives a W or NP or a final substandard grade for the course. Course repetition requests beyond the first repetition will require counselor authorization. In some cases, such requests will require a student to submit a special request for consideration after meeting with a counselor. When a course is repeated once or more, a maximum of the first two substandard grades will be discounted from the SMC grade point average. The original grade(s) will still appear on your transcript, but will be annotated to indicate the course was repeated. Fourth enrollments (third repetitions) or more are generally not permitted since the state of California does not provide funding for these enrollments. If a student is granted a special exception for a fourth enrollment, due to extenuating circumstances, (third repetition), however, the third grade will be calculated into your GPA. For example, if you earn an \"F\", then a \"D\", then a second “D” and finally a “C” grade in the same class, only the \"F\" and the first “D” will be removed from you GPA. The second “D” grade and the “C” grades would be calculated into your GPA. Up to “two” W’s maximum can be discounted from the calculation towards progress probation, once a grade in the course has subsequently been earned. Students are permitted to repeat a course in which a satisfactory grade has previously been earned but only under special circumstances authorized by California Code of Regulations Title 5 §58161. These circumstances include: Courses which Santa Monica College has designated as repeatable. In some cases, courses are grouped together because they are related in content. These courses may include several levels, but also have a cumulative course repeatability of three (i.e., a total of four course enrollments is permitted in the course “grouping” of Dance 43, 44, 45 and 46) Courses in which a student received a satisfactory grade, IF the original course was completed at least three (3) years prior to repeating it, AND the District requires a more recent completion of the course (see §55003), OR another educational institution to which a student seeks to transfer requires the course to be taken more recently than the student’s last enrollment in the course [note that the significant-lapse-of-time exception cannot be used if the student earned a substandard grade when last enrolled in the course.]; or Variable unit open entry/open exit credit courses, where a specific portion of the course needs to be repeated as permitted by Title 5 §55044 of the California Code of Regulations; or Courses where satisfactory work has been recorded, but repetition is necessary for a student to meet a legally mandated training or cooperative/occupational work experience requirement (e.g., government-required licensing, certification, recertification) as a condition of paid or volunteer employment. Please note that these courses may be repeated any number of times, and the grade received each time will be included when calculating the student’s grade point average. Repeating a course that a student originally completed with a grade of A (4.0), B (3.0), C (2.0), or P (Pass) will have NO effect on the student’s GPA or units completed. If you have received a \"D\", \"F\" or \"NC\" in the a class you do not plan to repeat, please make an appointment with a counselor to discuss if you are eligible for academic renewal and/or progress renewal.

You should also always have your own copy of transcripts for reference or use in counseling sessions. A student can speak to a counselor to request their college transcripts evaluated for the following general education patterns: AA, IGETC and CSU. Once you have your transcripts, schedule an appointment with a counselor to determine if your classes count toward an AA degree and/or transfer, and to request a preliminary transcript evaluation.",

      "answer": "A unit is the amount of credit you receive for successfully completing a class. Units also give you a clue about the approximate number of hours the class meets each week. For example, a 1 unit class will meet about one hour per week for the semester, while a 5 unit class will meet about 5 hours per week for the semester. Units also are an indicator about the level of difficulty of the class. The more difficult the course, the more units you receive for successfully completing that class.

      "question": "How many units should I take per session?",
      "answer": "The number of units you should take per session depends on what other commitments you have in your life, such as work, parenting, etc. It will help you in planning your schedule if you have an idea about how much time you need to dedicate to your classes, so here is a good rule of thumb: For taking classes in a semester, multiply the number of units you will be taking times 3. That will tell you how many hours you will need each week between going to class and doing homework outside of class. For example, if you are planning on enrolling in 12 units in a semester, you will need 36 hours (12 x 3) each week to dedicate to school - which is almost a full-time job! Remember, it is not the number of classes that will determine how busy you will be - it is the number of units you enroll in. Taking three classes that total 7 units is very different from taking three classes that total 11 units. The general guidelines for the number of units you should take in a semester are as follows (the maximum allowed is 16): 40 hours of commitment per week (work, parenting, etc.) - take 3 to 6 units30 hours per week - 3 to 6 units20 hours per week - 6 to 9 units 10 hours per week - 9 to 12 units Fewer than 10 hours per week - 12 to 16 units Since the Winter and Summer sessions are only 6 or 8 weeks long, the classes are much more condensed, move at a more rapid pace, and meet for more hours during each week. For taking classes in a shorter session, multiply the number of units you will be taking times 6. That will tell you how many hours you will need each week between going to class and doing homework outside of class. For example, taking 6 units in the summer session means you'll need about 36 hours (6 x 6) each week to dedicate to school - again, almost a full-time job! The general guidelines for the number of units you should take in a Winter or Summer session are as follows (the maximum allowed is 8): 40 hours of commitment per week (work, parenting, etc.) - 3 units 30 hours per week - 3 units 20 hours per week - 3 to 6 units 10 hours per week - 6 units Fewer than 10 hours per week - 6 to 8 units",
