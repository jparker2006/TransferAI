Effective Fall 2017, major preparation will be required for this major. For details, visit: http://admissions.ucsd.edu/MajorPrep Students must apply to be directly admitted to the Structural Engineering major. Transfer students must have completed the following courses in order to be considered for admission to the Structural Engineering major. • Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A) • Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B) • Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C) • Differential Equations (Math. 20D) • Linear Algebra (Math. 18) • Complete calculus-based physics series with lab experience (Physics 2A-B-C) • Chemistry 6A For more details regarding transfer admission, please visit the Undergraduate Admission page on our website; https://se.ucsd.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-admission Effective Summer 2024, the Structural Engineering major will no longer be considered a selective/capped major. Students who are not directly admitted into the major can switch into the major by using the Major/Minor Tool on TritonLink. Courses that have not been articulated and do not show an equivalent transfer course on ASSIST.ORG must be approved via petition on an individual basis by the SE department. Special Advising Note: The following courses are recommended preparation for all transfer students considering admission to the Structural Engineering major. Preparing well for the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation. • Matlab based algorithms and programming for structural engineering or equivalent • Statics or equivalent While structural engineering is often viewed as a sub-discipline of civil engineering, we take a cross-disciplinary approach to structural engineering at UCSD by developing an undergraduate curriculum, fully accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering Technology), as well as a full graduate program, emphasizing structural design of not only civil engineering structures, (such as buildings, bridge, and earth dams) but also aerospace structures, mechanical structures, offshore, and marine structures. A cross-disciplinary education allows our graduates to find employment in any of the above mentioned engineering disciplines, which provides the student with great flexibility in employment after graduating with a B.S. in structural engineering.
