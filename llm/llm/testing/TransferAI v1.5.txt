============================================================

===== Test 5: Can I take CIS 22A and CIS 36B to satisfy anything in Group 1? =====
# ‚ùå No, based on verified articulation logic

Your courses partially satisfy **Group** 1.
You've matched: CSE 8A, CSE 8B, but they span across multiple sections. To satisfy **Group** 1, all UC courses must come from the same section.
