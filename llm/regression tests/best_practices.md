# TransferAI Development Best Practices

## Code Structure and Organization

### Module Organization
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between modules
- Group related functionality into cohesive packages
- Follow the established project directory structure
- Keep modules focused on a single responsibility

### File Naming and Structure
- Use descriptive file names that reflect their purpose
- Keep files at a manageable size (<500 lines when possible)
- Order functions/classes from high-level to low-level detail
- Group related functions within files

## Coding Standards

### Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Limit line length to 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Documentation
- Document all public functions, classes, and methods
- Include docstrings with parameter descriptions and return values
- Explain complex algorithms with inline comments
- Update documentation when changing code

### Type Annotations
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Leverage Pydantic models for structured data
- Document expected data structures
- Use appropriate collection types (List, Dict, etc.)

## Logic Block Handling

### Logic Block Structure
- Always validate logic blocks before processing
- Handle edge cases (empty blocks, single items, etc.)
- Support both dictionary and Pydantic model formats
- Maintain consistent structure throughout processing

### Course Validation
- Normalize course codes before comparison
- Handle case insensitivity properly
- Account for course equivalencies and substitutions
- Implement robust honors course detection

### Complex Logic Processing
- Break down complex logic into testable functions
- Handle nested logic structures consistently
- Support both AND/OR operations uniformly
- Provide clear explanation for logic decisions

## Error Handling

### Exception Philosophy
- Fail early and explicitly
- Use specific exception types for different error conditions
- Provide helpful error messages with context
- Log detailed information for debugging

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs at system boundaries
- Convert between formats consistently
- Provide clear feedback on validation failures
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Write tests for all logic paths
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test with realistic data samples
- Maintain independent test cases

### Test Organization
- Match test structure to code structure
- Name tests descriptively
- Document test purpose and expectations
- Group related tests in test classes

### Mocking Strategy
- Use consistent mocking patterns
- Mock external dependencies
- Document mock behavior expectations
- Use fixtures for common test data

## Performance Considerations

### Algorithmic Efficiency
- Consider time complexity for operations on large datasets
- Avoid redundant processing of the same data
- Cache results of expensive operations
- Optimize critical path functions

### Resource Usage
- Minimize memory consumption for large operations
- Release resources promptly when no longer needed
- Consider pagination for large result sets
- Monitor performance metrics in production

## Integration Points

### API Design
- Design clear, consistent APIs
- Document API contracts thoroughly
- Version APIs appropriately
- Handle API errors consistently

### External Dependencies
- Isolate external dependencies behind interfaces
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Implement appropriate timeouts
- Cache external data when appropriate

## Continuous Improvement

### Code Review
- Review all code changes before merging
- Focus on readability and maintainability
- Verify test coverage for new functionality
- Ensure consistency with project standards

### Refactoring
- Regularly refactor complex or duplicated code
- Extract shared functionality into helper functions
- Improve naming and documentation during refactoring
- Maintain test coverage when refactoring

### Technical Debt
- Document known technical debt
- Address debt incrementally with each release
- Prioritize debt that impacts reliability or development velocity
- Allocate dedicated time for debt reduction

## Security Considerations

### Data Handling
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily
- Use appropriate access controls
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies
- Scan for security vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions
- Review changes in dependency updates
