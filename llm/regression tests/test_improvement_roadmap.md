# TransferAI Test Improvement Roadmap

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

### Strengths
- Good unit test coverage of core validation functions
- Comprehensive test cases for binary response generation
- Existing integration tests for major user flows

### Weaknesses
- Brittle tests dependent on exact string matching
- Inconsistent mocking approaches
- Missing edge case coverage
- Limited documentation of test intentions
- Tests skipped due to implementation inconsistencies

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Improvements

### 1.1 Implement Test Fixtures
- Create standardized test fixtures for common test data
- Develop a comprehensive set of mock ASSIST data
- Build helper functions for test setup/teardown
- Document fixture usage patterns

### 1.2 Improve Test Runner
- Add detailed test reporting with categorized results
- Implement test timing measurements
- Create visual progress indicators
- Add support for running specific test categories

### 1.3 Setup CI/CD Pipeline
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Implement pre-commit hooks for test validation
- Create test coverage reports
- Set up notification system for test failures

## Phase 2: Test Case Improvements

### 2.1 Refactor Brittle Tests
- Replace exact string matching with semantic validation
- Create string pattern matchers for flexible validation
- Implement tolerance for formatting variations
- Develop custom test assertions for common validations

### 2.2 Standardize Mocking Approach
- Create a centralized mock registry
- Implement consistent mocking patterns
- Document mocking best practices
- Create helper functions for common mock scenarios

### 2.3 Expand Edge Case Coverage
- Add tests for empty/null inputs
- Test boundary conditions systematically
- Create tests for error handling paths
- Add performance edge case tests

## Phase 3: Test Documentation and Organization

### 3.1 Improve Test Documentation
- Add detailed docstrings to all test methods
- Document test data generation process
- Create test case catalog with examples
- Document test dependencies and assumptions

### 3.2 Reorganize Test Structure
- Group tests by functionality rather than module
- Implement test class inheritance for common behaviors
- Create test utilities package
- Standardize test naming conventions

### 3.3 Add Integration Tests
- Develop full end-to-end tests for main user flows
- Create integration tests with mock API responses
- Implement cross-component integration tests
- Add regression tests for fixed bugs

## Phase 4: Advanced Testing Strategies

### 4.1 Implement Property-Based Testing
- Introduce property-based testing for core algorithms
- Create property validators for course matching logic
- Develop generators for realistic test data
- Test invariants across input variations

### 4.2 Add Performance Testing
- Establish performance benchmarks
- Create load tests for response generation
- Implement memory usage tracking
- Set up periodic performance regression testing

### 4.3 Implement Snapshot Testing
- Create snapshot tests for response formats
- Implement visual diff tools for response changes
- Add snapshot versioning for controlled updates
- Document snapshot update procedures
