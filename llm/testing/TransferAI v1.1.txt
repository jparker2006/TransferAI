🧠 AI: 📨 **TransferAI Response:**
Hi there! 👋 Thank you for reaching out. I understand your concern about satisfying CSE 30 requirements.

Unfortunately, based on the validation result, it seems that completing only CIS 21JA and 21JB will not satisfy the CSE 30 requirement. You are missing CIS 26B and either CIS 26BH or CIS 21JB (depending on which option you choose).

To satisfy CSE 30, I would recommend considering one of the partial match options:

Option A: Complete CIS 21JA, 21JB, and CIS 26B.

Option B: Complete CIS 21JA, 21JB, and CIS 26BH.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. I'm here to help! 😊

🔍 Found 1 matching document(s).

🧠 AI: 🤔 Hi there! As your trusted UC transfer counselor, I'd be happy to help you with that question. 😊

Unfortunately, taking only BIOL 6A and 6B will not satisfy the requirement for BILD 1 (The Cell). According to the validation result, you're missing several courses: BIOL 6AH, BIOL 6C, and BIOL 6CH.

Option A suggests that if you take those remaining courses (BIOL 6B and 6C), it might partially satisfy the requirement. However, taking only BIOL 6A and 6B won't cut it.

Option B indicates that there are no matching courses taken, and you need to complete all four courses: BIOL 6AH, BIOL 6B, BIOL 6C, and BIOL 6CH.

To satisfy the requirement for BILD 1, I recommend taking the full sequence of BIOL 6A-H. This will ensure that you meet the necessary coursework requirements for your UC transfer. 📚

Does this make sense? Do you have any questions or concerns about this? 😊
