🔧 TransferAI LLM Perfection Roadmap
📍 Final tuning for De Anza → UCSD Computer Science articulation before scaling

❗ Bug Fixes (Logic Errors & Invalid Results)

Test	Issue	Fix	Status
Test 7	Fails to validate CSE 8A + 8B as a full Group 1 Section A path	Add multi-course section validation logic	✅ Fixed
Test 20	Incorrectly answered “Yes” to “Is MATH 1A different from MATH 1AH?”	Force binary comparison for functionally equivalent honors/non-honors paths	✅ Fixed
Test 21	Omits MATH 20B in dual-UC course query	Parse and respond to every UC course mentioned	✅ Fixed
Test 30	Drops CHEM 6B when both 6A & 6B are mentioned	Fix compound UC parsing to always include all courses	✅ Fixed
Test 31	Says “Yes” to “Does CIS 36A satisfy more than one UC course?”	Add UC articulation count check — if only 1 match, return ❌	🔲 Not yet started
Test 32	Doesn’t answer “Are honors required?”	Add binary “required” validator based on logic_blocks	🔲 Not yet started
🧠 Prompt Design Improvements

Problem	Fix	Status
Too passive (“You may take…”)	Use firm binary phrasing (✅ Yes / ❌ No)	✅ Active
Inconsistent yes/no formats	Template binary responses: “✅ Yes, based on the official articulation logic…”	✅ Active
Confusing multi-UC responses	Always list each UC course with its articulation result (✅/❌ per UC course)	✅ Fixed (via Test 21)
🛠️ Validation Enhancements

Weakness	Enhancement	Why It Matters	Status
Lacks combo validation summary	Build structured output (UCs matched, CCCs used, ✅/❌ status)	Required for complex articulation groups	🔲 In progress (partial)
Only outputs unstructured text	Add optional structured fields: satisfied, missing	Enables dashboard logic, APIs, automated QA	🔲
No partial match warnings	Show alerts like: “⚠️ You’re missing CIS 26BH…”	Prevents confusion & false positives	✅ Active
Fails to group CCCs under UC headers	Group CCC articulation logic per UC course	Improves traceability & auditability	✅ Implemented in Test 21 fix
❓ Prompt Gaps to Cover

Gap	Example Prompt
Honors-only path	“If I take only honors courses (e.g. CIS 22CH, MATH 1AH), can I still transfer?”
Invalid mixed logic	“Can I take CIS 22A and CIS 35A for Group 1?”
Ambiguous group-only query	“What should I take for Group 2?”
Course with no articulation	“What happens if CSE 21 isn’t articulated?”
Redundant CCC input	“If I took both CIS 22A and CIS 36A, which one counts for CSE 8A?”
✅ Pre-Scale QA Checklist

Requirement	Status
All group-level logic types pass (choose_one_section, all_required, select_n_courses)	🔲 Partial
Every UC course in a query is independently parsed and validated	✅
"Partial match" detection works and explains missing components	✅
Binary prompts yield explicit ✅/❌ answers with explanation	✅
Honors are correctly marked as “optional” unless required	🔲 Test 32 pending
No dropped logic in multi-UC prompts	✅
LLM never contradicts ASSIST logic or invents mappings	✅
Structured combo validation output is available	🔲 Planned
🚀 Once All ✅ Are Met…
