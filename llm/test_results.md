🔍 Found 1 matching document(s).

📘 UC: CSE 8A
📗 CCC: CIS 22A, CIS 36A, CIS 40

🧠 AI: Based on the articulation summary provided, here are the De Anza courses that satisfy CSE 8A at UCSD:

**Option A:** CIS 22A
**Option B:** CIS 36A
**Option C:** CIS 40

These are the only options listed in the articulation summary as satisfying CSE 8A.

===== Test 2: Do I need to take both CIS 36A and CIS 36B to get credit for CSE 11? =====
🔍 Found 1 matching document(s).

🧠 Validation: ✅ Satisfies Option B with: CIS 36A, CIS 36B 

📘 UC: CSE 11
📗 CCC: CIS 35A, CIS 36A, CIS 36B

🧠 AI: Based on the official articulation summary, I can answer the student's question as follows:

**Option to satisfy CSE 11:**

* **Option A:** None (since there is no single De Anza course that satisfies this option)
* **Option B:** CIS 36A, CIS 36B (complete all)

To satisfy the UC San Diego course CSE 11, the student must complete both CIS 36A and CIS 36B.

===== Test 5: Does De Anza have an equivalent for CSE 21 at UCSD? =====
🔍 Found 1 matching document(s).

📘 UC: CSE 21
📗 CCC: None

🧠 AI: Based on the official articulation summary, I can provide the following answer:

**Option A:** None (This course must be completed at UCSD.)

Since the course is part of Group 2 and requires all courses to be completed at UCSD, there are no equivalent De Anza courses that satisfy the UC San Diego course CSE 21.
